### Mother Night

First read of this one... kinda wacky, but I like the thought experiment about consequence.

### Sirens of Titan

A reread of a Vonnegut Classic. Got this and all his work in [fancy hardcover](https://amzn.to/4gVvsKS) and it’s been rad to read them again.

### End of the World and the Hardboiled Wonderland

An expanded new translation of my favorite Murakami novel. It’s been a while since I read the original translation so I can’t be certain what was added back, but the story was still compelling and weird.

### The City and Its Uncertain Walls

Another go from Murakami at fleshing-out an early novella. Sort of a sliding door of Hardboiled Wonderland. I loved the library and its old director. I did miss the noir aspects of the other version, but something about winter in the mountains was lovely. 

### Gnomon

Hard to follow at times, but fun and mysterious. I spent a while on the puzzle code but much like the one in Vandemeer, gave up after a while. 

### Absolution

A bit scattered in the final third/didn’t love Lowry in this incarnation.

### The Fragile Threads of Power

Glad to see this series continue even though there was a little more schlocky romance than I remembered. 

### The Likeness

A good procedural re-read.

### 2312

KSR you’ve done it again.

### Available Dark

What if the detective was also a fuckup

### New York 2140

Just imagine the smell

### Until Thy Wrath Be Past

Fun to see how this got turned into a show.

### Witch King

Felt like it was gearing up for a series but found a good ending.

### Aurora

Maybe don’t go to space.

### Poster Girl

Fun.

### Aleph Extraction

Spies in space is still a hit.

### Moonbound

Loved it.

### Sign Here

A fun mephistopholic slow boil. 

### A Country of Ghosts

Anarchy!

### Jumpnauts

Some interesting bits of Chinese mythos sadly in a book with a lot of bad love triangle and blockchain.

### Player Piano

Vonnegut started strong.

### The Cat Who Saved Books

Cute.

### The Book You are Looking for is in the Library

[Life-affirming](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/books/what-you-are-looking-for-is-in-the-library-michiko-aoyama.html).

### In Ascension

Kinda wild!

### Some Desperate Glory

Cool take on a space epic.

### Death’s End

A good conclusion.

### Hummingbird Salamander

Vandemeer with a compelling eco thriller.

### The Dark Forest

Watched the Netflix adaptation of the first and a bit book while reading this which mostly just made me confused about who was who. Also I wish there were more women in the books who weren’t a sci-fi writer’s idea of a perfect wife.

### Three-Body Problem

I’m dreading the Netflix show but this was slow to start but super interesting once it did.

### Camp Zero

An interesting take on climate apocalypse.

### Agent Running in the Field

Le Carre kept writing bangers his entire career.

### Shards of the Earth

Enough mystery to make the trilogy appealing, and strong characters.

### Hell Bent

A fun sequel to Ninth House.

### Book of Night

I like this trend of urban magic stuff.

### Super Cannes

JG you’re a freak for this one.

### Vessel

Cool story, if a little goofy at times.

### Static Ruin

Does it stick the landing? Yep.

### Void Black Shadow

This series continues to be cool.

### Murder on Sex Island

lol.

### Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep

The movie makes so much more sense now.

### A Murder of Quality

A fun little murder mystery.
