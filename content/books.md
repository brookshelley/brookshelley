### A Country of Ghosts

Anarchy!

### Jumpnauts

Some interesting bits of Chinese mythos sadly in a book with a lot of bad love triangle and blockchain.

### Player Piano

Vonnegut started strong.

### The Cat Who Saved Books

Cute.

### The Book You are Looking for is in the Library

[Life-affirming](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/books/what-you-are-looking-for-is-in-the-library-michiko-aoyama.html).

### In Ascension

Kinda wild!

### Some Desperate Glory

Cool take on a space epic.

### Death’s End

A good conclusion.

### Hummingbird Salamander

Vandemeer with a compelling eco thriller.

### The Dark Forest

Watched the Netflix adaptation of the first and a bit book while reading this which mostly just made me confused about who was who. Also I wish there were more women in the books who weren’t a sci-fi writer’s idea of a perfect wife.

### Three-Body Problem

I’m dreading the Netflix show but this was slow to start but super interesting once it did.

### Camp Zero

An interesting take on climate apocalypse.

### Agent Running in the Field

Le Carre kept writing bangers his entire career.

### Shards of the Earth

Enough mystery to make the trilogy appealing, and strong characters.

### Hell Bent

A fun sequel to Ninth House.

### Book of Night

I like this trend of urban magic stuff.

### Super Cannes

JG you’re a freak for this one.

### Vessel

Cool story, if a little goofy at times.

### Static Ruin

Does it stick the landing? Yep.

### Void Black Shadow

This series continues to be cool.

### Murder on Sex Island

lol.

### Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep

The movie makes so much more sense now.

### A Murder of Quality

A fun little murder mystery.
