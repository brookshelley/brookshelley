### The End We Start From ###

A poignant story about motherhood and survival. Kind of a one-two punch with the last book.

### How High We Go in the Dark ###

I loved this meditation on loss and love. It captured a lot of the complex feelings I’ve had over the years about family and belonging.

### Six Wakes ###

An original and exciting take on cloning and space travel.

### Killing Gravity ###

More of a novella, but a fun one. Some echoes of Becky Chambers, but with a core concept similar to Hanna. Excited to read the rest of the series.

### Dead Silence ###

Really cool space horror that nicely dovetailed with playing Dead Space. Spooky and hard to put down.

### An Unkindness of Magicians

Similar thematically and story-wise to a lot of fantasy I read these days, but compelling characters and hilariously brutal and brief spell battles mark it out.

### The Employees

The objects are good.

### Chilling Effect

Fun but a little too silly.

### ‌Something New Under the Sun

A friend asked if this was Solarpunk, and I'm not sure, but I said yes.

### Winter Tide

A nice take it and turn it of Lovecraft.

### Neuromancer

Re-reading for a Discord group. Not my favorite of his trilogies, but still fun.
