## 2021 {#2021}

**The Dragon Republic** — R. F Kuang

After the whiplash of the first book in the trilogy from school-based fantasy to brutal warfare, this book was refreshing in being exclusively brutal. I'm excited to see how the series ends, and it's also nice to be so clearly rooting against the Hesperians.

**Trick Mirror** — Jia Tolentino

A wide-ranging essay collection on modern social networks, marriage, and assault. Definitely worth a read, though at times it's pretty tough to get through depending on your background. Fuck marriage. Fuck Twitter. Fuck the world of conservative "christianity".

**Random Acts of Senseless Violence** — Jack Womack

This was a wild book. Written as diary entries, it follows the quick dissolution of a middle-class life in New York with the backdrop of the US falling apart completely. I'm not a huge fan of books that affect a dialect, but eventually it was easier to follow. A very depressing speculative fiction.


**The Quantum Thief** — Hannu Rajaniemi

Ooh, a new trilogy to dive into. I had a pretty hard time understanding a lot of the technology terms Rajaniemi made up, but by the end I'd gotten used to them enough that I could just enjoy the story. This book was nowhere near as confusing as Ninefox Gambit, but definitely required a bit more investment than many mainstream sci-fi tomes.

**Company Town** — Madeline Ashby

A cool take on post-climate-collapse sci-fi, with a complicated badass protagonist. A good escape read for the holidays.
