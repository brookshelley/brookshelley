### An Unkindness of Magicians

Similar thematically and story-wise to a lot of fantasy I read these days, but compelling characters and hilariously brutal and brief spell battles mark it out.

### The Employees

The objects are good.

### Chilling Effect

Fun but a little too silly.

### â€ŒSomething New Under the Sun

A friend asked if this was Solarpunk, and I'm not sure, but I said yes.

### Winter Tide

A nice take it and turn it of Lovecraft.

### Neuromancer

Re-reading for a Discord group. Not my favorite of his trilogies, but still fun.
