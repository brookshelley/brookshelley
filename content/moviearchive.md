## 2021

**Black Christmas**

The calls are coming from inside the house! Margot Kidder is so absurd in this. The whole thing is a mess but also a classic that inspired a whole series of slashers.

**Don’t Look Up**

The comedy version of contemplating the inevitable death of everyone you know to climate change in the next 10-30 years…
So yea! Bleak!

**The Great Outdoors**

Not the best Hughes, but it had weird moments of charm.

**Into to the Spiderverse**

Saw this in theaters, but the rewatch really held-up. Absolutely gorgeous animation and a fun story. Still by far the best comic book movie.

**Dr. Strangelove**

An utterly madcap story of bureaucracy and silliness. This is up with Armando Iannucci's work on the absurdity of the US government and our attempts wage endless wars.

**The Matrix: Resurrection**

For a movie that had to explain its own existence metatextually, it was pretty fun.

**Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City**

I love these goofy movies. This is maybe the best video game adaptation? It covers the first two games pretty well and has some solid action with decent actors I’ve seen in various Canadian TV shoes.

**The French Dispatch**

The first third of this movie I couldn't tell if I found it amusing or entirely up its own ass--probably its both! The emotions of this film are refracted too many times to have any real effect, but on the upside the font for the subtitles was nice. I haven't seen an Anderson film since Moonrise hit theaters, so perhaps I'm just out of love with his work. Timmy Chalet is the most fourteen y/o-looking twenty-five y/o since Schwartzman. The final acts was my favorite, mostly because of Wright and Schreiber.

**The Mummy (2017)**

None of the fun of the original but some of the action sequences were neat.

**Lincoln**

parts of this were great but a lot of it felt like Sorkin nightmare.
great hats.

**The Mummy**

I haven’t seen this since I was a kid and its still fun. Watched to prep to listen to Blank Check. 

**No Man of God**

I didn’t know much about Bundy before this, and I might not after, but I enjoyed the ride.

**Dogs Don't Wear Pants**

It seems like they jumped to breath-play pretty fast in this one. I like the portrayal of kink as a way to heal.

**Boogie Nights**

Somehow I’d never seen this. Every performance is a little more unhinged than the last. A delight.

**Super 8**

Cloverfield meets the Goonies. Underrated fun.

**Last Night in Soho**

A fun romp through swingin’ London.

**Power of the Dog**

Take that, peach scene. This is the fucked-up gay Phantom Thread.
Damn.
Amazing soundtrack and just a delightful story.

**The Feast**

Just a chill Welsh dinner party. Bring the family.

**Unstuck in Time**

This hit me like a ton of bricks. So good and weird and sad and wonderful.

**Night Raiders**

A great anti-imperialist sci-fi with a solid cast. It was great to see Cree ritual and language throughout the film.

**Night Raiders**

A great anti-imperialist sci-fi with a solid cast. It was great to see Cree ritual and language throughout the film.

**Ronin**

A classic. Absolutely riveting action with great gritty characters.

**Venom: Let There Be Carnage**

A pretty solid comic movie, even if none of it was super new or wild.

**Mullholland Drive**

Oops I did it again…

**Shang Chi and the Ten Rings**

Significantly more fun than most Marvel films. This movie largely stands on its own as a fun martial arts film.

**Gretel & Hansel**

Visually stunning but poorly paced. 

**Mitchells vs. the Machines**

A delightful tale of a fucked-up family.

**Water Lilies**

November is turning out to be a lot of rewatches. This held up, and it was cool to revisit the beginning of Adèle Haenel‘s career. I wish more directors were tackling the challenges of girlhood and sexuality with the same energy as Sciamma. 

**Attack the Block**

I guess this is a Doctor Who now.

My first rewatch in a while and it really holds up.

**Kate Plays Christine**

Eerily compelling. This could have been simply an exploitative look at a woman’s death but transcends the material to be a look at how we approach mental health and the voyeurism of suicide.

**Alien: Resurrection**

Definitely the weakest of the four, even if it has some solid actors. I hate the weird new alien the most.

**The Thing**

My umpteenth rewatch.

**Dracula**

Camp AF. Everything Gary Oldman wears is perfect.

**Addams Family**

A real hoot. Such a strange, fun movie. I haven't seen this since I was a kid.

**Alien^3**

I’d never seen the assembly cut, but dang, this is a grim movie. I wish Fincher had gotten to actually deliver on his vision, but sadly this is proably my least favorite Aliens film.

**Settlers**

A sad, but forgettable tale of a space colony.

**Saint Maud**

Just let a lesbian have a good time, damn.

**Dune**

YESSSSSSS THE SOUND, the beauty of every shot! It was so good it made me like tommy chalet better.

**They Live**

This so thoroughly influenced other media that watching it was a constant "oh yea!!"

**Titane**

If you’re gonna dragon a car there might be consequences. This was a nuts movie and I’m a little sad the car didn’t come back… what a deadbeat.

**The Card Counter**

Between this and First Reformed, I think that Schroeder is perhaps making the best films in the US that deal with our guilt and responsibility for the last two decades of war and devastation. A brutal and haunting score underlines a movie that will stay a with me for a while.

**No Time to Die**

A blast. A great second film to see in theaters.

**Spiral**

Not the strongest of the very goofy Saw series.

**Till Death**

Weirdly, the promotional images spoiled the suspense a bit. An ok thriller.

**Lucky Logan**

I’ve seen parts of this movie over people’s shoulders dozens of time during a flight, but the actual movie was very charming. 

**Creep**

A tight 70 minutes, but telegpaphed a little bit too much. I wonder what I woul’ve thought about this ten years ago.

**Night House**

An interesting look at grief and being haunted by our lost loved ones. I think I wanted this to be more hype House of Leaves, but it wash’s quite as wild. The music made me want to listen to Magnolia Electric Co.

**Big Trouble in Little China**

Kurt Russell is a great sidekick. Watching this again I realized how much of Tim Robinson’s delivery is based on this character.

**Free Guy**

A better Ready Player One meets Wreck It Ralph. 

**The Aviator**

Way of the future.

**Munich**

Chilling and excellent. It’s interesting to see james bond meet one of his foes for the first time.

**Zero Dark Thirty**

A very tense film that makes sure to only humanize selectively. It’s wild seeing an event that I read about in the news like this with Chris Pratt. Well-acted, and shot, but fuck. 

**Adrift in Tokyo**

A wholesome and cute rewatch. Joe Odagiri with a wild hair game.

**The Silence of the Lambs**

I haven’t seen this in years, and it sure is haunting. Five years or so ago I knew a few women who got spear of Longinus tattoos like Bill, which I still find wild. Goodbye Horses is a dope song.

**Eyes Wide Shut**

Still a fun and weird film but in the years since I first watched this, most of the bits now seem a bit tame. Who has an orgy without any kink?!

**You Were Never Really Here**

This is like the most grim John Wick. Well shot, but damn, it was grim.

**Palm Springs**

Unbelievably charming. My accidental JK Simmons fest continues with a far more fun character of his, and a solid Connor O’Malley. The best thing I can say about this is that it made me want to fall in love.

**Whiplash**

If the goal was to make every character absolutely insufferable, then this was a great success. The way the film obsessed over the sweat and blood conjured by JK Simmons being one of the most abusive characters on screen was fascinating. Not a fun movie. Because I’m a "such jazz head" I did enjoy the musical interludes.

**Heat**

Absolutely rad except for Kilmer’s ponytail. The dna of this film is in so many heist films for the past 20 years. Al Pacino talking about butts blew my mind.

**Old**

If you drink every time someone says older or younger you will die.

**Prisoners of the Ghostland**

Checkov’s ball bomb. This was silly, but ultimately didn’t live up to Sono’s other work. If this was his first film we could say "oh, that guy makes ok schlock," but I had pretty high hopes.

**It Comes at Night**

Not a great movie to watch during a pandemic, but definitely a tense one.

**Escape from New York**

Rewatched to listen to Blank Check. It’s hilarious to me that Kurt Russell is a libertarian.

**Annette**

Adam Driver is the worst joker yet. I don’t like musicals but this was so bizarre I enjoyed it.

**Wrath of Man**

Much more interesting than I first imagined. A wild ride of a revenge film.

**Kate**

A solid film. MEW should be in more action movies--imo she should take over Mission Impossible or something. Stylish and fast.

**Malignant**

Schlocky in a very 80s horror way. Not really scary at all, but just a bit silly and gory.

**Naked Singularity**

Fun and slightly surreal take on a heist and an underdog lawyer story. 

**The Colony**

An interesting post-apocolyptic tale with bits of Waterworld and NK Jemison’s Emergency Skin. I would’ve loved to know more about how the Earth stayed habitable, but that likely would be the long TV version of this story.

**Ex Machina**

Such an amazing film. The claustrophobic nature of the whole thing really enhances the haunting performances.

**We Need to Do Something**

I like what it was trying for but it didn’t capture my attention or really deliver.

**Antiporno**

I haven’t watched a Sono film in a while but man, it’s still a wild ride. I think Suicide Club is still the absolute best, but the absurdly surreal structure of this one was delightful.

**Sisters with Transistors**
Wow I knew very little about the history of women who pioneered electronic music. This was cool and full f amazing music.

**The Forever Purge**

Definitely the best of the purge films. A lot of action, and some solid, if not well-fleshed-out characters.

**Halloween**

A rewatch of a classic.

**The Fog**

Sometimes slow older movies just don’t hit.

**Basic Instinct**

Verhoeven’s idea of butch is pretty in line with my preferred presentation. We all need a friend who says "goddamn you dumb sonnafabitch you fucked her".

**Tropic Thunder**

It’s wild this got made.

**The House That Jack Built**

It’s still really confusing that some of y’all think Matt Dillon is hot.

**Demonic**

Meh.

**Pig**

Completely unexpected, and excellent.

**Assault on Precinct 13 (2005)**

A pretty good remake that concerned itself with being a fun movie over being true to the source material. Hawke and Fishburne delivered a solid action performance.

**Total Recall (2012)**

Way less memorable and funny than the original. This was a serviceable action film that reminded me of when Hollywood really wanted Colin Firth to be the new Tom Cruise.

**Total Recall**

Verhoeven is a master of cinema and this is up there with his best. Every Arnold scene is using him to his best, and between the makeup and plain silly puppets, it’s a blast.

**Assault on Precinct 13**

Watched so I could listen to more Blank Check. The premise is super absurd but the action was fun, and there were some very entertaining bits and camera shots.

**Titanic**

When this came out I remember taking a date to see The Wedding Singer instead and I don’t regret that choice. It was a neat disaster film once it got to that point, and Kathy Bates did a great job, but the romance bit didn’t do much for me. I mean, we’ve all made stupid choices in love, but don’t dive off a lifeboat for a boy you just met!

**What Lies Beneath**

A little spooky, but mostly rad because Harrison Ford is playing against expectations.

**Castaway**

So brutal and good. This is just hit after hit and makes you sad about a volleyball.

**A Quiet Place Part 2**

Spooky and a lot less "why?!" than the first film. I prefer Cillian Murphy to Krasinski.

**Beckett**

A competent but ultimately substanceless thriller. It was fun to watch JDW just run around and do wild shit.

**The Abyss**

James Cameron invented SMS. A real spooky, tense, wet time.

**Evangelion 2.0 - 3.0 + 1.0**

Much more compelling than the original series, with a solid ending.

**Riddick**

He almost lost his house over this.

**A Cure for Wellness**

Spooky fun, if a little too long.

**The Hunt**

Oof.

**The Retreat**

Revenge horror where a lesbian couple has to survive trip to the country. I recommend this to anyone who wonders why I don’t take more road trips.

**Mad Max: Fury Road**

Rewatched and if’s still delightful.

**Strange Days**

This is cyberpunk gold. I can’t believe it didn’t do well, that it used mini discs as a major plot point, or that it’s not available basically anywhere.

**Showgirls**

Transcendent. This was my first time seeing it after avoiding it because I’d made the mistake of thinking it was just schlock. I was wrong. There’s so much weird depth and fantastic camera work in this.

**The Suicide Squad**

Perfectly silly and fun. No pretension of being more clever than it needed to be. This is what super hero movies should be.

**Starship Troopers**

Such a brilliant satire of our country’s endless thirst for war. Verhoeven is a master.

**Chronicles of Riddick**

Just as over the top as I remembered, but I always forget Helen Mirren was in it. This is the start of their love affair. (Drew later told me this was actually Dench)

**The Town**

Saw this heist thriller when it first came out, and it held up.

**Martyrs**

Yow. That was a bizarre and brutal film.

**Scanners**

Somehow I hadn’t ever seen this absolute banger of a movie about telepathy and telekinesis. It’s delightfully Canadian and I’m sure inspired many an anime.

**After Midnight**

A way more interesting and charming film than I expected. A monster film cover for a movie about relationships and growing together.

**Jolt**

A goofy, but fun-enough action film. 

**The Master**

Why did we need the Joker when we already had this? A true weird PTA classic.

**Drug War**

A brutal, non-stop cop procedural. Guns akimbo? Yup. Betrayal and tons of Buicks? You bet.

**High Tension**

I forgot how fucked-up this is, and that they used Muse songs for the soundtrack.

**Blackhat**

This is my second viewing with my first on opening night. They should’ve called this movie "Himbo Hacker". This is the only movie I can think of with a dramatic scene where someone types ‘ls’ and also ‘cat’ in a terminal. As hokey as the whole thing is, the action slaps, and it’s a fun action romp.

**Midnight Special**

What a cool movie! What’s left unshown and unsaid kept this taunt and fun. Shannon spoke volumes with his eyes, and even the kid managed gravitas without falling into the haley joel trap. I don’t remember hearing about this movie at the time, but I think it deserves more hype.

**Gunpowder Milkshake**

On it’s face, this was made for me, but sadly it was a substanceless and somehow joyless exercise.

**Censor**

I had very little idea what was going on towards the end of this. Generally, I dug the vibe though.

**No Sudden Move**

A really outstanding cast made this a delight from start to finish. Full of fun twists and a brisk-moving story.

**Synchronic**

A cool time travel film about using drugs to wander around in the past and how that's not a great plan because of racism. Very interesting and though it's not quite the same wild as Primer or Los Cronoscriminos, it's up there.

**Insidious**

A spooky, but not very good horror film.

**The Tomorrow War**

I like the version of the world where enough people watch soccer worldwide that folks use the World Cup to announce vital information. I don’t like a world where a few heroes save the world after the governing bodies don’t help. Climate change is a collective problem and needs collective solutions. Also this is a fun movie so whatever.

**Fast 7**

A big ‘ol sob of an ending and a really fun movie.

**Werewolves Within**

A pretty perfect horror comedy. Sam Richardson is seriously talented, and if you haven’t seen Detroiters, get on that. The beats were great, everyone was doing a lot, and I laughed throughout.

**Come to Daddy**

Elijah Wood seems to only take fun projects in a post-LOTR world, and I love it.
His 2017 film I Don't Feel at Home in This World Again, Wilfred, voice-acting in
Miyazaki films, and now this short bowl cut and hooded-cape weirdo film are such
a nice career pivot.

**Demon Slayer: Mugen Train**

More like a few episodes than a cohesive film, this got me stoked for season 2.

**Resident Evil: The Final Chapter**

I’ve seen this one the most besides the first because I got to see it in Japan
before it came out in the states. That was a strange experience so it’ll always
stick with me.

**Resident Evil 2-5**

Hokey but fun.

**Resident Evil**

Classic.

**Red Dawn**

The original was a classic schlocky action film, and this one was an alright
action remake. I don't know if Chris Pine can live up to Kurt Russell generally,
but if you want to see him try, this is a film for it.

**Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It**

I’m a sucker for this very silly series. I love how much they malign and hate on
the spectre of "satanists". Walter Bishop from Fringr is in this and that was a
nice surprise.

**Saw 3**

The first three films in this series are in the perfect uncanny valley of bad
fashion. I should listen to the Why Are Dads episode now that I’ve made it
through because John is an absolutely insufferable dad.

**Saw 2**

I forgot the kid from Continuum was in this. Overall, this sequel was a lot
schlockier now that we know what the whole Saw deal is like. The nü-metal at the
end dates this more than anything else could.

**Saw 2**

I think I watched this shortly after it came out, but it’s still wild to see Ben
from Lost, Danny Glover, and the man in the mask from Princess Bride. This is a
classic absurd horror thriller, and this rewatch begins my staycation of Saw.

**Chappie**

Despite being very silly at times, this was a fun movie that explored
consciousness and the ideas of a learning AI. I think folks were disappointed
because it wasn’t serious at all times, but this played out like a cool sci-fi
short story.

**Together, Together**

Hilarious and deeply touching. I love this look at an unlikely friendship and
the complexity of pregnancy. Plus, Patti Harrison fucking owns.

**Free Fire**

Just a wild ride from start to finish. Watching everything go to shit, then get
worse was a delight.

**Chaos Walking**

This felt like the first few episodes of a longer show, and not really a whole
films. I enjoy Mads just doing weird shit though. When I first saw stills for
this I thought it was that Hideo Kojima game.

**Riders of Justice**

A fantastic black comedy one part John wick, and one part Planes, Trains, and
Automobiles. A truly weird and fun film. More Mads please.

**Army of the Dead**

I’m not a Snyder fan, but he’s made two good zombie films and this is one of
them. Silly, fun, and full of excitement.

Pacific Rim: Uprising Fun and silly, like what a Transformers move could’ve been
if they weren’t such hot trash.

**Dead Man Down**

Meh

**Set It Off**

Queen Latifah should’ve gotten a massage and romance scene. This is a classic
heist movie, and after hearing EPM talk about it I couldn’t believe I hadn’t
seen it before.

**Oxygen**

A movie set in tight quarters reminiscent of when Green Lantern got buried in
that one movie with just a lighter.

**Green Zone**

I still find it abhorrent we destroyed a country for no real reason. Matt Damon
plays a hapless but passionate action man well.

**Patriot Games**

Ah, the good old days of bad guy Sean Bean. This continues my tour of Harrison
Ford classics, and I’d forgotten all the talent in this film. A good spy
thriller and Ford makes a much better Ryan than Jim from the office.

**Without Remorse**

I’ve been on a Harrison Ford kick lately and looking forward to reexploring his
foray into the dad fiction of Tom Clancy, so it’s lovely seeing Michael B.
Jordan so thoroughly take on the mantle of spyman John Clark. Action trash
delight.

**Relic**

A real House of Leaves-esque situation. Is this perhaps a prequel to Under the
Skin?

Really though this was a deeply scary, haunting film about aging and our
responsibility to our loved ones.

**In the Earth**

A wild film that somehow manages to combine pandemic fear with supernatural
mushroom horror. Excellent. Two fun tastes that taste great together.

**Searching**

An interesting way to tell a story but I think the reliance on computer footage
hindered the overall story, despite strong performances by Cho.

**Training Day**

A classic Denzel/Fuqua film that starts wild and gets so much wilder. The way
Denzel delivers every line and just delivers looks is a delight every time.
Ethan Hawke is fine in this but I don’t think he has the charisma to counter
Denzel. Fun and disturbing, this is like a short-form The Wire, but in LA.

**Unstoppable**

Denzel Washington is too old for this shit, but not too old to stop a runaway
train. This movie rules.

**Sexy Beast**

Realized halfway through this is a rewatch, but Winstone and Kingsley are wildly
compelling regardless.

**I Care a Lot** I love an anti-hero, and pretty much every person in this film
is either horrible or an idiot, or all of the above. I also love a lesbian lead.
This managed to be twisted and funny, and I really dug it.

**Transsiberian**

Look I love a train mystery. I remembered halfway through this I’ve seen it
before.

**The Mosquito Coast**

What if dads but too much? This movie reminded me of some of the worst bits of
my childhood. At least my dad never made us move to the jungle. They’re remaking
this soon with Justin Theroux and I’m super excited to see how he channels the
deranged dad energy. ICE IS CIVILIZATION.

**Courier**

Wow who knew the real story behind the font was this intense!

**Nobody**

A blast from start to finish. This is the best action comedy since True Lies.

**Gone Girl**

Imagine if Tyler Perry had played Madea in this movie but with the same
character and level of seriousness. I think at a fundamental level a movie that
imagines "what if a woman fakes domestic abuse" is dangerous, but otherwise as a
film this was solid. Rosamund Pike was great as a nightmarish villain though.

**Sorcerer**

You’ve seen the Fast & Furious, but what about the Slow & Simmering? For a movie
largely about trucks driving below 10mph, this was a thrill ride. I should
rewatch Seaquest.

**Under the Skin**

Haven’t seen this since it came out, but the moody slow build and austere
soundtrack are haunting.

**Bad Trip**

Planes, Trains, and incredibly wild scenes. The restaurant scene was a standout,
but so many bits of this movie were amazing.

**Godzilla vs. Kong** Explosions, huge monster fights, and a surprisingly great
cast having a good time. Ideal summer entertainment. I guess I’ve seen every
film in the "monsterverse" now, and this was maybe the most fun? Long live
Godzilla, the KoM.

**Wet Hot American Summer**

A delightful rewatch. I forgot how many amazing actors were in this at the start
of their career, with absurdist performances from Michael Ian Black, Bradley
Cooper, and David Hyde Pierce. All the little bits, and the kids’ reactions to
them are hilarious. A classic. _smashing pottery sounds_

**Safe House**

Old spy/young spy. Not quite a Bourne or a Le Carré, but it was a fun thriller
even though I can’t quite take Ryan Reynolds seriously.

**Dante’s Peak**

This is a more focused predecessor to one of my all-time favorite movies, 2012.
James Bond does a science, while Sarah Conner slings espresso and does mayor
stuff. This move made me afraid of volcanos and hot springs and also children
driving. If there’s a genre called "my boss didn’t beleive me until it was too
late" this is firmly part of it.

**The Last Black Man in San Francisco**

The colors and light in this film are unbeleivable. Utterly gorgeous. Jimmie
Fails and Jonathan Major had incredible screen chemistry, with their
performances tied together with long pans. I can’t wait to see more Jimmie Falls
in films.

**Oblivion**

Somehow I hadn’t seen this until tonight. A delightful Tom Cruise sci-fi with a
pretty predicitable twist, and really goofy goggles. A+

**Sentinelle**

A nice and tight action film. The fights were well-coreographed, and there just
wasn’t much fat to trim. Fast, fun, and chill.

**Shadow in the Cloud**

A hat on a gremlin on a hat. This movie was initially kind of interesting, and
seemed like it would be a straight-up tale of misogyny in the sky, but then the
gremlin showed-up, and the zeros, and it just kept going.

**The Fugitive**

I hadn’t seen this since the 90s, and it really holds up. Ford and Jones amp up
the tension and make every scene worth watching. Classic.

**Space Sweepers**

I’d heard this described as a life action Cowboy Bebop, but sadly it has much
less style and substance. Parts of the world building were cool, but why did
they have to add a farting child?

**Barb and Starr Go to Vista Del Mar**

My friend texted me to say he was _cackling_ watching this--it was ok funny, but
I didn’t know it would be a "silly" musical. I don’t really know what this kind
of comedy is called, but it’s not my thing. It’s like Ace Ventura meets
Marshall’s with some real Paul Blart 2 vibes.

**The Little Things**

I don't know if I can ever take the sheriff from True Blood seriously, or even
Rami Malek. Denzel, as usual, is an imposing figure who oozes charm while
methodically saving a crime.

**The Thing**

The remake isn’t the same level of incredible that the original was, but it’s
still a pretty great alien film. I loved seeing a bunch of folks who went on to
be in lots of TV shows and other things I hasn’t seen when I originally saw this
film.

**Monster Hunter**

I don’t know what I expected from a movie based on a game with no plot. The
three stars are solely bc I love jovanovich and also every action scene was
absurd and delightful.

**Minari**

A gorgeous, sad, and brutal portrait of trying to make family and a dream work
out. The cinematography and soundtrack were a perfect pairing to one of the
cutest kids in cinema, and an outstanding performance by Yuen and Youn Yuh-jung.
This movie was so good it conquered my Texan's dislike of Oklahoma.

**The Dig**

A rather interesting film about excavating a ship from a mound in rural
Suffolk.Theres a wild WW2 backdrop, and a lot of Fiennes looking pensive as all
getout. Everyone is in love with someone they shouldn’t be, and I kept hoping
the kid was actually from the future.

**Insomnia**

Robin Williams is so good in this. I haven’t seen Insomnia since opening
weekend, and also forgot it was a Nolan. I still need to watch the original.
This is a great view of Pacino slowly losing his mind. I had this a little
confused with One Hour Photo so I kept expceted a scene to take place at a CVS
or something.

**The Prestige**

The one time Wolverine and Batman worked together with David Bowie to make
powerful magicks. I honestly forgot this was a Nolan film, but I’ve loved it
every time I’ve watched it. Just so fun and clever. I wonder how Golem’s cats
are doing?

**Never Rarely Sometimes Always**

Easily the best movie I’ve seen in a long time. The level of kindness and
empathy for the challenge of being a young woman in the world is outstanding.
Really incredible performances from Flanagan and Ryder with a candid view of how
amazing Planned Parenthood is to top it off. The focus on women caring for each
other was spot-on.

**The Bourne Supremacy**

In the world there is only one good supremacy: the Bourne kind. Brian Cox rules
in this, but I wish Julia Stylse and Franka Potente had more to do. I’m
rewatching this series and it’s mostly holding-up.

**Our Little Sister**

I love Koreeda movies because they so beautifully humanize a great deal of pain.
From his slow pans, to the way he shot the room to make you feel part of the
family, this movie ruled.

**The Lost City of Z**

It turns out the story of this movie’s protagonist was much more racist and
absurd than presented here. The vaporization of bullshit explorers of other
people’s lands is a bummer. This was well-shot despite apparent massive
innacuracies. Pattinson did a solid job.

**Yes, God, Yes**

A delightful look at a religious youth that was spot-on. I wish I had a cool
dyke bar to escape to from youth retreat, but otherwise this was pretty much
what creepy youth camps were like. Dyer is excellent, and Simons perfectly
inhabits a shitty priest.

**Promising Young Woman**

Woah. I think I’ll have to rewatch this to really get the full impact, but this
was intense and Cary Mulligan was fantastic.

**The Platform**

This was an interesting psychological sci-fi. We never learned why he brought a
book.

**Strange Negotiations**

Hoo boy this took me back. I saw Pedro the Lion play every year for a while back
in Austin, and his break with the religion he was raised with matched-up with
mine. This was a sweet and sad documentary about how lonely the road can be, and
the life of a medium-famous rock musician.

**Exit**

Tried to watch this on a night I was sleepy, and reader, it did not keep me
awake. Good, but it’s in the uncanny valley of the past.

**Jack Reacher: Never Go Back**

Is this in the MCU? One of my favorite parts is when someone cites military
legal code and a short while later a woman says "is there still an Internet cafe
around here?" I’m pretty sure reacher would still need to go to court for a lot
of murder.

**Paradise Hills**

Mills Jovavich rules. This movie is kind of a mess, but points for a bit of
queerness and a strong aesthetic. You just don’t see a lot of bondage gear in
white these days. Also, milk is always sinister and gross.

**The Operative**

For a spy film this left a lot on the table. There were some pretty tense scenes
but I’ve seen Kruger do much cooler stuff. I’m looking forward to the next
season of Tehran to get my fill of Mossad spy stuff.

**Enemy**

Villneuve is wild. This was definitely the strangest of his films I’ve seen so
far, but I loved the yellow-tinged madness.

### 153 Movies

**The Vast of Night**

A fun 50s-set sci-fi. The weird TV framing didn’t really go anywhere, but other
than that the film was a tightly-shot and enticing story.

**The Snowman**

I’d heard how horrible this was before I dove in, but I’ve also read the book,
so I found it not very confusing at all. There’s like, two twists? I don’t know.
This weemed like a pretty straightforward nordic noir.

**The Circle**

Entirely too heavy-handed, and kind of a waste of both Tom Hanks, Jon Boyega,
and Karen Gillan. I wish more folks thought that tech was this evil though. By
trying to make a more mass-market Black Mirror, it got a bit overwrought.

**Another Round**

Is it a good idea to be low-key drunk all day every day? This movie aims to
answer that eternal question. Perhaps the answer is getting drunk sometimes, but
not enough to wreck your life? Mads dances really well.

**Suspiria**

I love modern dance a lot more when it’s a satanic ritual. The original Suspira
is a masterpiece, but I really liked this strange _homage_. The music was
excellent, and Dakota Johnson was haunting. I wonder if Tilda had it in her
contract she would only do the film if she could Albert Nobbs it up.

**Fantastic Fungi**

I love the mushroom internet. Also this movie made me want to ingest a certain
drugge mushroom. Every mycologist and enthusiastic mushroom person was a delight
in this documentary. Neat.

**Doctor Sleep**

I’m still not sure that the Shining needed a sequel, but this was pretty fun
Stephen King fare.

**The Invisible Man**

Absolutely thrilling, and utterly terrifying. The gaslighting in this film felt
incredibly real. I loved that it took a typical horror trope and turned it into
a character study of a woman desparate to be believed. Excellent film.

**WW84**

A friend on Twitter suggested this was basically a Doctor Who Christmas special,
and yep! It was also the story of a single dad learning that nothing is free
inside capitalism. Kristen Wiig was good.

**You’re Next**

This was fine? I dunno. I kinda zoned-out a lot but there was a lot of murder
and an Australian lead actor lady.

**Peppermint**

A holiday revenge film that never answers the question: "how did this mom become
special ops trained in five years?"

**The Midnight Sky**

This was alright. I’m a bit disappointed Sunu bc so many of the actors are
usually outstanding. I can’t tell if they filmed this during COVID, but that
would make sense for it since there were like 6 people total.

**Greenland**

The diabetic son was a hat on a hat, but I guess they needed a plot reason
besides perimeter breaches and explosions to make the back half of this movie
work.  I generally love a disaster film, but this does little to unseat my
favorite nightmare: 2012. "Small molten debris" was a highlight. I will say that
the utter disorganization and nightmarish bureaucracy of the whole thing really
tracks with the USA I know though.

**Leave No Trace**

Started hiking more often recently, and so I figured it was finally time to
revisit the majestic Forest Park in cinematic form. This was a pretty sad film.

**Inception**

Another rewatch in my Nolan-spree. This was also excellent, and I’d forgotten
how cool the set-pieces were, especially the Bond-esque snow mountain. I wonder
if Nolan wanted to make a bond and someone told him no? I’m glad they did,
because I like the weird shit he makes instead.

**Dunkirk**

For a Nolan film this was surprisingly straightforward. I wasn’t familiar with
this battle until watching Dunkirk, but it was definitely different to see a
film that depicts a retreat. Brutal, and hopeful.

**Interstellar**

Rewatched this gorgeous film for the umpteenth time. There are so many
heartbreaking moments about fatherhood and trust that it always hits me pretty
hard. For a movie that’s almost three hours, it’s a tribute to how great it is
that I always want to rewatch. Because of the practical effects I feel like it
will likely look fresh for decades to come.

**Tenet**

Definitely not worth getting sick over, but at home? With my own whiskey? With
Snorri? Yea, this was fucking sick. Since ignorance is ammunition all I will say
is I enjoyed this film greatly and immediately started it again.

**Sea Fever**

A tightly plotted, claustrophobic film about slowing losing your shit on a boat.
Someone else described it as "X-Files before Mulder and Scully arrived" and that
seems pretty apt. There’s a little bit of The Thing in here too. A lot of
creeping dread.

**Queer Japan**

As a foreigner who spends a month or so in Japan every year, and as a queer
woman, I really enjoyed this documentary. I loved that they chatted with trans
folks, HIV+ folks, and disability rights folks. One man described Japan’s
discrimination as "soft shell", and I think I get a lot more of why that is
after seeing this film. They even covered the strong anti-racism movement in
Japan fighting against nationalism. This documentary was a delight. It also made
me miss hanging with my queer friends in Osaka quite a bit, or singing karaoke
with a bunch of cool weirdos in Ni-Chome.

**Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy**

The atmospheric style of this movie is incredible. I love the slow build and
tension, with its tight plotting. Oldham makes an excellent Smiley, and
generally everyone is just a delight. RIP Le Carre. Also the soundtrack of this
film is excellent.

**Black Bear**

Aubrey Plaza is a singular emotional rollercoaster in this twisty film. I still
don’t know how I feel about it, but it’s definitely something I’ll sit with for
a while. It’s at turns incredibly painful to watch, and hilarious.

**The Taking of Pelham 123**

Ah, I love a Walter Matthau movie. There’s certainly a lot of language/behavior
that doesn’t hold up, but this is a real classic heist movie.

**The Bourne Identity**

What if Jason was just gaslighting everyone for the whole film, and he only
pretended to have amnesia bc he hated his job? Great action, great car chase,
and a really good haircut given to Franka Potente. I love a good spy thriller.
The closing Moby track still slaps.

**Black Christmas**

Ah, I love Imogen Poots. She’s great in everything she’s in, but I’m definitely
glad she’s not her character from Green Room in this. A horror film that tackles
the terrible world of reporting and holding men accountable for rape and the
challenge of female solidarity in the patriarchy. College is the worst; never
pledge.

**The Good Shepherd**

I forgot i’d seen this in theaters back in 2006. Matt Damon is very serious, and
Eddie Redmayne is yet to make his finest film: Jupiter Ascending. His lips still
worry me greatly. I think Angelina Jolie tried to look dowdy but it’s not
possible. Spies always have cool glasses. There should’ve been more Lee Pace.

**Lucy in the Sky**

I had no idea what to expect with this film, but it was certainly surprising.
The last thing I expected was for it to be way closer to that astronaut lady who
wore adult diapers and drove across the country to get revenege. Googling just
now, apparently that story was the inspiration for this movie. Wild. Since this
movie has Legion in it, I guess it’s also part of the marvel universe.

**Happiest Season**

This was disappointing. A more astute lesbian friend suggested this movie
should’ve leaned inrto quirky indie-ness or fully into Meet the Parents schlock.
It did neither. The ignored sister would’ve been much better as a butch woman.

**Centigrade**

After a very cold night camping, I decided to watch this movie about slowly
freezing to death in your car in Norway. I’m super glad I get to watch this with
some wine and a wool blanket. Being super cold sucks! For a movie completely set
inside a car, this is pretty well-shot and compelling. It was based on true
events, I guess, but the whole baby thing was a hat on a hat.

**Paul Blart Mall Cop 2**

I watched this because of Til Death Do Us Blart after listening to the cursed
podcast for a few years now. Somehow it was both different and worse than I had
imagined based on the podcast. Long live the shadow man.

**#alive**

Ah, a simple zombie film updated for a world with social media. This was fun.

**Objectified**

It’s interesting watching this again 11 years after it came out. I’m once again
using A MacBook Air, and I understand the Muji designer way better. I wonder how
many CAD designers are still using 24" square displays?

**Night Moves**

The movie where Zuck gets really into direct action. "Killing all the salmon so
you can run your fucking iPod whenever you want". It’s really a shame he went
back to running his nightmarish company after this. There’s a delightful Griffin
Newman role near the end too.

**All About Lily Chou-Chou**

This is one of my all-time favorite films, but I hadn’t watched it in probably
10 years. Fortunately, it more than holds up as a sad and beautiful tale of
shitty teen life. It’s a brutal film because kids can be cruel.

**Johnny Mnemonic**

Ah, a 90s cyber classic. Somehow I’d never seen this before today! Ice T with
upside-down paintball goggles! Beat Takeshi! Udo Kier’s trans body guard! A
military internet dolphin!! I would love to see this screenplay get remade.

**The Wolf of Snow Hollow**

Ostensibly a horror film, but mostly about a man’s alcoholism and what it’s done
to his family and his life. Interesting take on the genre.

**Mortal Engines**

A fun YA-turned film. I don’t usually like Hugo Weaving but his big character
acting worked for this. I didn’t expect much, so I had a good time.

**Tokyo-Ga**

It’s wild to see how little Tōkyō has changed since the 80s--or rather the bits
of Shōwa that still peek through. This was a gorgeous look at both the Tōkyō
that once was, and the echo of 50s and 60s Americana that lived in the youths of
the time. I also learned quite a bit about Ozu, and how he filmed. Loved it.

**Columbus**

Gorgeous and sad. Two people meeting while their lives are paused for their
parents and sharing a love of architecture without building a romance. The pace
was pretty slow, but I like this kind of slice of life film.

**The New Mutants**

As a fan of the comic series and a few of these characters, I like that they
tried to give them a horror story beginning, but ultimately it felt constrained.
I’m disappointed that this won’t be part of the MCU or integrated with the
X-Men. The comics are having a heyday, but for some reason the movies are still
just not there.

**アキラ**

子供の時に私はアキラが一番好きので、十回の見た。特に今はそのちょっと変な映画、で
も大好きの。昭和の有名映画と最高アニメと思う I watched this a bunch as a kid.
It’s super weird but it really holds up. A true classic.

**The Wolf of Wall Street**

After the painfully sad movie about the hundreds of thousands who lost their
lives in tsunamis, I dove deep into this three hour epic of utterly nightmarish
depravity. DiCaprio plays what a friend calls Catch Me If You Can 2 very well:

**The Impossible**

The real lesson of this movie is that in 2004 kids were satisfied with only
getting a red ball for Christmas. This is also a Spider-Man origin story. Brutal
movie generally though.

**Possessor**

For context, I’ve loved the concept of assassins since I was a little girl, as
odd as that might sound. A movie wherein an assassin mind-syncs with a random
person to do their business is thusly fascinating. The horror of that connection
and the challenge of doing your job basically in a coma with all of the gore and
wildness that entails was thrilling. I love the obvious skill growth since
Antiviral as well.

**Election**

Not sure how I hadn’t seen this yet. A delight. I love the successful lesbian
sideplot, and how Broderick’s character fully self-destructs out of hate of a
precocious child. Fantastic.

**Proxima**

It’s hard to be a divorced mom while you’re an astronaut. Luckily, Eva Green is
still super cool. At this point I’m curious if it’s a contractual thing to show
her breasts once every 20 minutes? Instead of a movie about space, this was more
of a movie about space-prep.

**The Dark Knight**

Ah, Heath Ledger. When this was made no one thought the joker was a hero, and
yet, he became a bummer symbol for folks years later. It’s still weird to me
that they switched actresses suddenly, but Queen Latifah is hard to resist, so I
get it.

**Enola Holmes**

A fun movie to watch while waiting for these damnable election results. Millie
Bobby Brown plays a great younger Holmes, while Cavill is an oddly fit Sherlock.
The action moved briskly, and the little asides and jokes were charming. I’m
here for a low-stakes adventure anytime.

**Batman Begins**

This is probably the fourth or fifth time I’ve seen this movie and it’s still
such a blast. I wish it were easier to hear anything Batman says, but otherwise
a delight.

**She Dies Tomorrow**

I wasn’t sure what to expect, but this is a very _art_ film vibe with a slow
horror built-in. It definitely didn’t fit my mood tonight, but I’m not sure if
that’s the film’s fault. Perhaps I should’ve stuck with schlock.

**Earthquake Bird**

The vibe of 80s Japan is a whole thing. So much hip Japanese literature I’ve
read is firmly grounded in Showa-era Japan, so this felt a bit like watching a
multi-cultural Murakami story. It’s rare to see a movie or show in both Japanese
and English (Giri/Haji) comes to mind. I wish they’d worked with Vikander a bit
more on her Japanese though.

**Last Holiday**

Heard about this from an Election Profit Makers bonus episode and honestly, I
loved it. Sometimes you need something funny, kind, and hopeful. Thanks, last
holiday, for soothing my nerves.

**Zodiac**

This was my 3rd of 4th rewatch. I’m a sucker for a slow burn Fincher film. I was
still low-key mad that the other movie I watched today wasn’t a crime film, so I
had to dive into one. Everything about this movie is so wild and well-executed.

**Sinister**

Fellow-Austin native Ethan Hawk slowly loses his mind while trying to write
true-crime. If only he’d known you could just do a podcast instead! The worst
ever character from the Wire is also in this. Overall, not very spooky but it
leans a _lot_ on goofy jump scares. Nice use of Boards of Canada though.

**The Phantom Menace**

Dammit Blank Check why did I do this to myself in order to listen to your
commentary track. Seriously though, the 10 episodes about the only entry in Star
Wars that was ever made were excellent. Thank you for the bonkers good time.

**Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula**

There’s no train in this one, despite the title that I think was used to make
sure us goofy Americans realize it’ related to the previous film. I loved the
taxi lady. This film had more of a Mad Max vibe than the original which was fun.

**Train to Busan**

Continuing the zombie movie rewatches, I threw this on in order to remind myself
what it was like before watching the sequel that just came out. It’s just as
good as I remember it, though I fundamentally don’t like "fast" zombies. Zombies
should shamble. The wild melee of this film is a very different kind of fear
than the slow horror of inexorable zombie overrunning of your position.

**World War Z**

A more intense pandemic movie. I’ve watched this three or four times, and it
still manages to be one of the more interesting and compelling zombie action
films. By throwing out the creeping dread for a much more agoraphobic zombie
fear, this movie makes me glad I stay inside.

**Blackhat**

This movie dares to ask the bold question: "can a himbo code?" I don’t
understand why most of the terrible coding examples are windows INF or registry
files, but hey, it’s fun and stupid. I think this was also the first film I saw
where it was obvious that US action films are now mostly funded by Chinese
financiers.

**Collateral**

I think I’ve seen this before, but didn’t remember much. I love the extremely
tight shots inside the cab, and the real LA traffic vibe. This is the same LA
time period as the L Word.

**Borat Subsequent**

A hoot. This wasn’t nearly as salacious as the build-up implied, but there were
some big laughs, and a surprisingly endearing lock-in with some Q Anon weirdos.
I wish they’d gotten more Pence action.

**Save Yourselves!**

The initial cast was a reprise of the friends from Search Party, so one could
almost imagine this was an alternate reality retelling. Fortunately, this movie
morphs into a cute and weird duo alien invasion story pretty quick instead.

**The Trip to Italy**

Unlike the first Trip film I’ve never seen this one before. I like how Coogan’s
character has changed it up a bit, and generally this film felt friendlier. I’m
excited for the next two.

**Jennifer’s body**

The entire movie I just kept thinking, "what! They’re in this too?!" I missed
this movie back in the day and I think it was largely maligned, but it’s a near
weird little horror film. It only takes around 15 minutes to get creepy, and
then it goes off the rails in the most weird ways. Even JK Simmons was in this!
Amy Sedaris! The lesson here is: don’t trust scene kids, just stick with your
best friend. The men in this film are the real monsters, obviously.

**Vampires vs The Bronx**

A fun horror film about gentrification with a great cameos from folks like Zoe
Saladaña and The Kid Mero. Truly a great time.

**The Assistant**

I didn’t know much about this going in, only that it was well-regarded. Julia
Garner is outstanding in an incredibly brutal film about a sexually abusive and
horrible movie producer that definitely *wink wink* isn’t based on anyone who is
currently serving 23 years in prison.

**Evangelion 1.11 & 2.22**

A friend watched Evangelion for the first time recently, and I was reminded I
never got around to watching these remakes/retellings. Really, really weird, but
in a new ways. I kind of like that they cut out many of the extraneous
slice-of-life stuff.

**Ava**

I love an assassin film, but this one managed to make everything feel a bit
smaller and more banal. Pretty forgettable with the stakes of a lifetime drama
but the fight scenes of an action film.

**Wall E**

Super cute and dystopic. I love this movie so much.

**Mr. Jones**

This was nothing like that Counting Crows song, but it was excellent. I didn’t
know this story before watching the film, but fuck. I wish Vanessa Kirby had
more to do, but I suppose that’s the issue with historical fiction.

**The Long Dumb Road**

A great buddy road movie. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is one of my all-time
favorite movies and this channels the delightful failures and wonderful moments
of the genre perfectly. I should’ve watched this a while ago.

**Blade Runner: 2046**

This held up though I wanted more McKenzie Davis scenes. Also! I forgot Ana de
Armas was in this. Neat.

**Mission Impossible 6**

Outstanding! After a little bit of a slump in 5, six was back to the wild
heights of 4. The HALO jump was nuts, especially after looking into how they
filmed it. I can’t stand Alec Baldwin, but everyone else in this is dope. A+
helicopter scenes as well. There’s car, and motorcycle chases, and even some
outstanding Tom Cruise runs.

**The Da Vinci Code**

A real stinker, but silly enough to watch over a phone call with a pal. Ian
McKellan was the best part of this film, with a close second being Bettany’s
ability to look tortured and have sexual tension with literally everyone in
every scene.

**Mission Impossible 5**

A fifth movie and a fifth director. Renne is back, which I’d forgotten, and also
this movie brings some truly wild times. This is the first time the IMF goes up
against the Syndicate, and has a kinda fun Opera battle. There’s no huge
building this time, but there was a big swimming scene.

**Mission Impossible 4**

Benji, you fucking did it--you’re out in the field. I’m pretty glad Simon Pegg
became a series regular, and especially glad that barely anyone else from
earlier in the series didn’t. I do wish Keri Russell would come back though, bc
she’s cool. Also this one has Stellar Skateboard.

**Mission Impossible 3**

Aw, yea... JJ Abrams is here with Felicity and that guy that’s in everything he
makes! This was a really fun time at the movies. So many printable face masks!
Phillip Seymour Hoffman! Tom Cruise running! A terrible love story! Also, who
can forget the ridiculous [Nokia
phones](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/mission-impossible-3-on-
nokia-n93-3549677.html) they used in this.

**Mission Impossible 2**

Definitely not as good as the first. John Woo is great, but some of his
signature shots and slo-no effects just come off kinda silly in this.

**Mission Impossible**

What a blast from the past. The special effects were largely practical, which
means they aged well, but the computer interfaces are delightfully 90s. I can’t
believe how much this series has upped itself every incarnation, but this first
one is still just a nice small-scale spy film.

**The Trip**

I’ve enjoyed Coogan since the Day Today sketches he did with Chris Morris, so
it’s fascinating to see him age and keep doing odd versions of himself on film.
Rob Brydon is excellent in this, and I’m reminded I should rewatch the entirety
of Gavin & Stacey. If you want to see two middle-aged men making very stupid
(but funny) jokes and impressions while sampling haute cuisine in the north of
England, this is your chance.

**Class Action Park**

I don’t know how I survived the 80s and 90s. I did a lot of really, really
stupid and dangerous shit, even if I never got to go to Action Park. We had
Schiltterbahn where I grew up, which was way less wild, but still pretty
dangerous at times. This film does a good job of showing the teen thrills of
incredibly shady theme parks.

**Boys State**

I can’t stand the little conservative assholes. Steven Garcia was chill though.
Also, it’s surreal to see how far right everyone went out of an assumption that
other kids would be conservative, despite that being somewhat untrue. I went to
UT as well, and it was pretty nostalgic to see Clark Field and other spots I
spent a lot of time on film.

**Jack Reacher**

Not the best of the Tom Cruise action franchises, but fun enough. Light on
action till the end.

**Genocidal Organ**

I watched this a while ago before I read the book. It’s kind of a fascinating,
if quite gory, look into what we do for "security" and how our definitions of
other are constructed.

**Nightcrawler**

Despite a lack of blue skin or a tail, Gyllenhaal embodied a character just as
bizarre and rigidly pursuant of his beliefs. Deeply strange film.


**Violent Cop**

This is a rewatch, but I think it’s been at least 15 years since this first time
I saw it. Beat Takeshi is a treasure. This movie is delightfully filmed. I kinda
love the 80s Japanese film look, which is more reminiscent of TV than film. A
classic

**An Evening with Beverly Luff Linn**

I hope folks had fun making this movie... it felt like everyone was trying a
little to hard. This felt like an extended Tim & Eric skit. Everything was just
off.

**Sputnik**

I thought this would take place in space, but it’s mostly a fairly tight alien
captive story. Enjoyable but not too wild or original.

**The Rental**

Ok, I’m glad I don’t have to stay in any Airbnbs soon after seeing this creepy
movie. Whether it’s spycams, or the slow dawning realization that someone is
watching, the way the vacation unfolds in this film is super scary.

**Alien: Covenant**

Ah, I love this ridiculous sequel to Prometheus. I think it captures the
creeping horror of Alien and Aliens quite well, and is chock full of cool
actors. I hope Scott keeps making solid Alien films for a while to come.

**Contact**

Still liked this movie, but the weird romance plot was uncomfortable AF. Also
the way religion tied into it was hamfisted.

**2:22**

Watched this so I can enjoy this week’s How Did This Get Made. It wasn’t great,
and tried a little too hard to be clever without actually being entertaining.

**John Wick 1-3**

Rewatched all the John Wick movies out of a desire for action and style, and
they delivered. This series isn’t super substantive, but it’s an action movie
smorgasbord.

**Prometheus**

A deeply satisfying addition to the Alien canon. I’ve watched this move a number
of times, and it continues to thrill me.

**Barista**

I don’t watch a lot of documentaries, but this was pretty fun if a little
telegraphed. The only downside to this film is now I want coffee, but it’s
1130pm.

**Ride Your Wave**

The creator of Devilman Crybaby and The Tatami Galaxy made a really delightful
anime about adulthood and love. It was gorgeous and pretty touching, even if it
made me really wish I could fly somewhere again. There’s also a weird parallel
between this show and every season of Terrace House: namely there’s surfing, and
firefighters.

**Money Plane**

A true piece of crap. Everyone in this film seemed like they mostly work on
Cinemax soft core films.

**Spectre**

A delightful rewatch.

**6 Underground**

Continuing my tradition of watching mediocre Netflix thrillers, I think I’m
almost done with the current set. Ryan Reynolds is doing his sarcastic guy
thing, and there’s tons of fast cuts and action stuff. The first action scene
felt exciting for a bit, but by the twelfth hat-on-a-hat and shitty rock song I
was hoping for relief. Fortunately it got better later, but I wish this’d been
modeled more on Fast & Furious and less on xXx. I wonder if Bezos watched this
and thought "I’ve trained for this!"?

**Extraction**

Thor trades his hammer for guns in this exciting action film without much behind
the action. Sometimes you need to watch stuff get blown-up without much plot.

**Time to Hunt**

Outstanding thriller that kept building and moving throughout. I saw this on a
sci-fi list, but for the most part this felt like a slightly alternate reality,
vs something in the future. Very fun.

**Bad Boys for Life**

This series is epically ridiculous, and fun throughout. Everyone seems to be
having fun, and there’s a lot of wild action and even a surprise third act trip
out of the country.

**The Old Guard**

Fun but ultimately thin action flick. Solid action near the end, but so much of
it felt emotionless in a way that was just not super entertaining.

**Greyhound**

Tom Hanks has a fantastic presence, but they don’t really develop many other
folks in this tense battle movie. Which, hey, that makes sense, since the whole
movie they’re just depth charging the shit out of the sea.

**Bridge of Spies**

A solid Spielberg feel-good negotiation thriller. I only knew a little about the
U2 bomber and our history of capturing spies until I watched this film and dove
into Wikipedia. This movie made me miss Berlin, which I’ve only visited once for
a few weeks, but was delightful. If you enjoy the work of Tom Hanks, he does his
thing well in this movie.

**Gemini Man**

I can only imagine a certain "religion" has also cloned Will Smith at some
point. This was way more fun than it had a right to be, and weirdly enough the
young Will CGI was pretty solid. How long until we see movies with young Cruise,
or Washington? Have a bottle of wine and turn your brain off for 2 hours.

**‌式日**

This was a lot of movie. When I was younger I think I had more patience for
particularly slow films, but I ended-up being a little distracted during 式日.
I’m glad I finally got to watch it though, as it was pretty interesting seeing
Iwai on the other side of the camera. Also I really miss being in Japan now.

**Waiting for Guffman**

Ah, a classic. It’s wild seeing Fred Willard in this looking so young
comparatively. I watched this obsessively in high school and it really, really
holds up.

**Nightmare on Elm Street**

Did you know Depp was in this? I certainly didn’t! This is the second movie I’ve
watched because of the podcast **The Scaredy Cats** wherein one host of Reply
All tries to help the other host inure himself to horror films. With all of the
cultural cachet this movie had, it was interesting to see how quickly they
showed Freddy himself. Freddy also seemed shorter than I imagined. I also always
find it funny when all the "high school" actors are in their twenties. Why not
just set it in college?

**Upgrade**

An interesting take on the post-human world. It’s a schlocky, funny, gory AF
film, and not very into its own violence. Also it was rad to see Betty Gabriel
from Get Out again.

**Sonic the Hedgehog**

Weird how much more low-key enjoyable this was than the last movie I watched.
From the delightfully bad puns, to Jim Carrey having way too much fun, to Ben
Schwartz just being himself, this was a nice Saturday afternoon romp. I went in
expecting basically nothing, and was pleasantly surprised.

**The Dead Don’t Die**

This movie so badly wanted to be clever, it is the film equivalent to wearing a
"funny shirt" from Hot Topic and explaining the joke to everyone before they can
even laugh.

**The Lodge**

One of the better horror films I’ve seen in a while, with a very scary house,
and an excellent secluded location.

**Saturday Night**

A fun documentary with rather overwrought camera-work that shows what preparing
for and shooting SNL is like. It’s kinda wild to see the sheer number of writers
and staff that make it come alive.

**The Exorcist**

Pretty creepy, with great special effects considering the time. I always root
for the demons in any one of these, and definitely wondered while watching this
how many more kids priests hurt than these imagined evil spirits. The devil, it
turns out, was the church all along.

**Vivarium**

Started creepy, got way creepier. I appreciate the unwillingness to tell the
viewer what the fuck is happening. This plays out like a great Ursula K Le Guin
novel.

**After the Storm**

Koreeda is one of the best directors when it comes to presenting the sadly funny
banality of life. I can’t fathom someone else who could present a deadbeat dad
and dysfunctional family with such pathos. This isn’t quite as heartrending as
Shoplifters, but it comes close.

**Game Night**

Just a good time. Everyone seemed like they were having a great time, and it
hopped along at a good clip while keeping me laughing.

**Hustlers**

I love a good grift. I’m still low-key mad this wasn’t about a lesbian romance
between J Lo and Constance Wu though.

**The Commuter**

A perfectly serviceable train thriller. Pretty fun.

**Jumanji: Next Level**

Have you ever wanted to see the Rock play Dan Devito? What about Jack Black
playing a younger black guy? This movie was more bizarre than the last but hey,
it was also fun.

**Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle**

The extras’ costuming in this film is deeply strange, with a mix of "Indiana
Jones pan-middle-east" and "Mad Max". This whole film was a glorious mess, and I
loved it.

**The Guest**

This was surprisingly funny and very bizarre. I really enjoy Dan Stevens, ever
since his turn as Xavier’s son Legion.

**Prisoners**

In preparation for the eventual release of the new Dune film I wanted to
familiarize myself with Villneuve’s ourve. This is a very good mystery film with
a grittier Gyllenhal than his turn at Zodiac.

**Rythym Section**

A training montage revenge flick that slowly transforms into a pretty thrilling
action movie.

**Bloodshot**

"I don’t mind the scars, I just don’t like the stories they tell." With a
time-to-tanktop of just under 5 minutes, you know from the jump this will be a
new Diesel vehicle. This movie had it all: underwater tai-chi, weightlifting,
Guy Pierce, and a drinking competition to hone in on Vin’s favorite shot. Of
course, as a Chinese-financed movie, there’s no blood or sex or skeletons. Also
why didn’t they put that one guy’s eyes in his head instead of on his chest?!

**Radius**

Interesting conceptually, but it didn’t really go anywhere besides the concept.
It would’ve been better as an anime, lol.

**Portrait of a Lady on Fire**

Well, fuck. That was gorgeous and sad. This movie built until my heart ached,
and wove a story of falling in love.

**Crawl**

It’s no Underwater, but I guess if you want to see a great reason not to visit
Florida, this is a perfect anti-ad.

**Underwater**

This turned out was cooler that i was expecting. Can’t say much more without
spoiling anything.

**General Magic**

After seeing the fictionalized versions of many of these folks in Steve Jobs,
and hearing so many stories about others--some of whom I’ve met--this was a
really interesting look at a company that catalyzed much of what we use every
day to live online.

**Steve Jobs**

Oh, hey, it’s Shiv! It’s kind of fascinating that the entire story is told
through the lead-up to the presentations that implanted Steve Jobs in so many of
our brains. I really enjoyed seeing this, and also think it’s funny this came
out only 2 years after the Kutcher film. Also, Fassbender has a way cooler vibe
that the actual Jobs... I mean, he’s Magneto!

**The Social Network**

One of the wildest things about this movie is the that Facebook’s valuation at
the time of the credits rolling was only $25 billion. A few years later, it’s
nearly 500 billion. I left Facebook 3 years before this film came out, and
briefly returned while in Portland. I get the sense the characters in the film
might be less likable in real life.

**Apollo 13**

Such a fantastic film. It’s surprising how well this held up, with many
practical effects and no terrible CGI. It’s been 25 years and this one still had
me on the edge of my seat.

**Overlord**

This felt a bit like a video game. Lots of nazis getting blown up? Weird
underground lab? Strange NPCs? Check.

**Birds of Prey**

It’s a low bar, but this is definitely the best DCU movie since all the serious
Nolan Batman films. Not only was it silly fun, it managed to build interesting
characters and solid battles that put the overwrought CGI-fest of Avengers to
shame. I hope if they make more of these they keep the formula. I really want to
see a love story between Poison Ivy and Harley.

**1917**

A very intense movie but it was also beautiful in its own way. I get why this
won awards. Weird cameo by Doctor Strange though.

**The Martian**

Another rewatch. I had a FaceTime call where my friend Lena and I discussed Halt
and Catch Fire, which reminded me how much I enjoyed this film, which I took to
be about the competence of McKenzie Davis’ character. This was my first time
watching this movie in 4K though, which made it look pretty amazing. Also, I
always forget Donald Glover was in this.

**Skyfall**

Perhaps one of the only movies to use a Land Rover Defender in a car chase, this
is pure fun. The filming and action scenes were a wild step-up from the previous
two films, and the stakes felt high throughout.

**Quantum of Solace**

Far less memorable than Casino Royale. The first chase was fun, but a lot of the
rest of the film kinda just meanders. I do appreciate the little nods towards
older James Bond films though.

**Casino Royale**

Rewatching this in preparation for the eventual release of the final Daniel
Craig bond film. It holds pretty well, save for the hilariously old-looking Sony
phones and bootcut khakis. I’d forgotten Mads Mikkelsen was in this.

**Contagion**

I saw this in the theater when it first came out, but I haven’t seen it since
then. This felt like a timely movie considering our current circumstances. I
forgot Jude Law plays a weird crank reporter.

**Jojo Rabbit**

A deeply strange film about learning how to be a person and unlearn fanaticism.
There were some pretty excellent cameos in this, and a very dark comedic beat.

**Phantom Thread**

Wow, this movie was hilarious from top to bottom. A friend (hi Drew) invited me
to see it for the first time in 70mm, and all I want to do is channel Woodcock
every day. "What am I supposed to do with that?". What a joy. I can't wait to
watch this again.

**First Love**

A strange mistaken gangster film. This was much more straightforward than many
Takeshi Miike films, but still managed to add in some really bizarre bits, and
even some surprises.

**Elle**

Yow. That was... a lot of movie. Isabelle Huppert was fantastic, but I don't
know if I could recommend it. Definitely one of the stranger Verhoeven movies
I've seen.

**Anna**

Another lady assassin movie. It was a helluva ride and I enjoyed it. I don’t
think it added anything huge to the genre, but I’m just glad to have more cool
movies about tough women. That said, I wish Anna had been able to just be with
her girlfriend instead of randomly fucking spymasters.

**Genocidal Organ**

I read the book this movie is based on last year, and it’s a truly brutal story
of linguistics and massive unrest. This movie is grim in a way that feels a
little too prescient. Definitely one of the better anime thrillers I’ve seen in
a while though.

**Psycho Pass Movie Trilogy**

After season 3, Psycho Pass had a trilogy of films in Japan. They’re fun
continuations of the characters from all three seasons, and a bit of a sequel to
the first movie. The future this film presents is pretty grim, but the animation
is fantastic.

**Weathering With You**

I found out I don’t need to worry about climate change because it’s just rain,
ya know? This film was gorgeous and fun and o loved the cat in it with my entire
heart.

**Matrix: Reloaded**

Really starting the year off right. We talked through most of the exposition,
which was like 75% of the movie. I hadn’t seen this since it came out, and it
really didn’t hold up.

**The Lighthouse**

The first thing I noticed in this film was the tight, constrained feel of a
square frame with deep black and white images. I immediately had to look around
for [how this was
made](https://www.musicbed.com/blog/filmmaking/cinematography/breaking-down-the-
cinematography-of-the-lighthouse/). The VVitch is one of my favorite movies of
all time, and Eggers doesn't disappoint in this haunting film either. The dread
builds as the antipathy between the two men grows. A joy.

## 2019 {#2019}

### 74 Movies

**Ford vs. Ferrari**

A blast! I love car racing so much, and this film was a gorgeous vision of a
famous showdown between an incredible car company, and Ford. I grew up hearing
stories about Shelby, and this film brought him to life.

**Uncut Gems**

This was wild! From front to back this movie was a rollercoaster of poor
decision-making and the world of vigs, 3 way parlay, and Kevin Garnet. Adam
Sandler showed that he could really act in Punch Drunk Love, and he absolutely
owns in Uncut Gems.

**One Cut of the Dead**

Without spoiling it, all I’ll say is this film went to fun places I didn’t
expect, and was a delight throughout.

**Psycho Pass**

The episodes of this show already feel fairly cinematic, so stretching the show
to nearly 2 hours felt right. It was super jarring to hear random English
throughout the film though—at the start I thought I was accidentally watching a
dub.

**Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker**

Frankly [this post from Film Critic
Hulk](https://www.patreon.com/posts/emperor-only-has-32504876) covered my
feelings well. I described it as a movie trying to fellate itself. Scenes rarely
got to breathe, and the movie felt packed with fan service and confusing
backtracking from Last Jedi. Also wow, they just dropped a bunch of character
storylines.

**Ad Astra**

Space Brad Pitt! We’ve sent most leading men to space, but never Pitt (I didn’t
check this too carefully). Also this had Donald Sutherland, who is a personal
favorite. I appreciate that none of the things in space made sound at least. Sad
dads in space. It was pretty, and exciting, but ultimately didn’t really give me
much to latch onto.

**Ready or Not**

Lol can't wait to never get remarried. Rich people are the worst. Also it's a
real bummer that "satanists" get such a bad wrap in a world where the christians
are the ones actually harming children. Fuck the [satanic
panic](https://overcast.fm/+VX6lxzezs)

**Knives Out**

Sadly, I wasn't feeling great so I missed a bit of this, but I think I got all
the important bits. I really want to see this again in the near future. The
overall tone of the film was fantastic, and the comedic hits were delightful.

Second time emphasized how excellent this film was. A really great ride.

**Fast Color**

The preview of this movie had me hoping it was a potential adaptation of NK
Jeminson's Broken Earth trilogy, but alas, it wasn't. Fortunately, it was still
a fun movie about family and mutant powers. I wish there was a little more
substance to the whole film, but on the upside, the mood was pretty interesting.
Also it's weird seeing a belter as a sheriff (please see the Expanse for more
details).

**Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives**

I’ve had this on my to-watch list for years, and finally decided to dive in. It
was a beautiful and strange mediation on life, death, and family.

**Terminator: Dark Fate**

A nice return to form. This felt like a nice natural extension to Terminator 2,
and while it wasn't a great film by any means, it was a fun romp with lots of
goofy jokes, explosions, and Mackenzie Davis.

**Edge of Tomorrow**

This was a rewatch after a listening to a recent episode of the
[Incomparables](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/485/). I have a
special place in my heart for movies where Tom Cruise is supposed to be a tough
guy, and if you add in mechanized suits? Hell yes. It’s not the best film, but
it’s very fun.

**In the Shadow of the Moon**

A mid-flight watch on my way to Tokyo. Pretty interesting, engaging flick that
gets weird.

**Parasite**

There isn’t a lot I can say about this without spoiling the whole endeavor, but
suffice it to say this movie is incredible. There’s _so much_ going on in every
shot, and the actors performances are incredible. This is a rare movie that just
keeps building and building throughout. Truly one of the best directors working.

**What We Do in the Shadows**

A rewatch of an utter classic of mockumentary. So many quotable lines and
absurdly delightful scenes. The last word in vampire media.

**The Art of Self Defense**

The dialog delivery was definitely from the Yorgos Lanthimos school of deadpan,
and the general vibe was extremely absurdist. I loved this film. Quite a bit of
this movie was unexpected, and had me cracking up. A genuinely odd delight.

**The Day Shall Come**

An utterly bizarre and fantastic satire about the very real lengths the state
goes to in order to prop up folks with no real chance of committing “terrorist
acts”. It’s worrying watching [this
interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqUsiV8LPkM) to get more behind the
scenes of this film. Morris makes seriously strange stuff, and this is no
exception.

**High Life**

Space dads! I don’t know if this is a genre, but perhaps it should be since
Interstellar, High Life, and Ad Astra all appear to answer: "what if dads, but
in space". However there was a _lot_ of assault in this film... it’s largely
about felons being jettisoned into space, and artificial insemination
experiments, it turns out. If you like very grim space movies, this might be for
you.

**Promare**

A wild visual ride with a rather bizarre (it’s Trigger, naturally) story of fire
people and the folks who fight them. There’s mecha, tons of goofy jokes, and
even though it felt a little long, it was fun.

**Eighth Grade**

The idea of this movie made me _very_ anxious. Middle school is rough, and I was
on edge for most of the film wondering if something very bad would happen, or if
Checkov's AR-15 would reappear. **Spoiler Alert** No. There're definitely some
sad moments, and some very tender and sweet ones, but no one big terrible event
occurs. This isn't that kind of movie. Instead, Eighth Grade perfectly
encapsulates how nervous and awkward we felt in our youth, and just how
embarassed we were by our parents. I loved it.

**Between Two Ferns**

I love the parallel world of these bizarre and failed actors. I haven’t seen
very many episodes of the web show, but this was pretty fun.

**Aniara**

TL;DR: Low-budget sci-fi cruise ship. This movie reminded me of a Twilight Zone
episode, at least in its premise. I really enjoy movies where something goes
horribly awry, and "what if we're stuck in space forever" definitely meets that
criteria, but unlike the Twilight Zone, there's no big twist, just a slow
sadness. There's a certain charm to the fact that it's Swedish as well. Plus,
there’s space lesbians. We’re everywhere.

**Mega Time Squad**

Completely silly and fun. Low-budget time travel movies are often awesome (think
Primer), but what if it was also a very low-brow comedy? Sweet as.

**Booksmart**

Wow, I really should've watched this in the theater. This movie ruled.
Outstanding cast, hilarious from start to finish. I want so many more amazing
comedies that center rad women. More. Lesbian. Characters. In. Everything.

**Steven Universe: The Movie**

I'm not super fond of musicals, and this was most certainly a musical.
Generally, I've enjoyed Steven Universe, but more so when it's weird, and not
saccharine. This movie leaned more towards the latter, so it was cute, but not
really my bag. If singing and supportive friendships are your favorite part of
the show, you'll love the movie. TL;DR your ex's polycule adopts you.

**Godzilla: King of Monsters**

Ridiculous, but exactly what I expected. A bit of Godzilla, a bit of the Core.
I'm fascinated by the idea that "eco-terrorists" have wide-reaching military
power, lol. Shin Godzilla is still the best movie in the series, hands down, but
this was a silly action romp.

**MI-5**

I fondly remember the British show *Spooks*, which ended in 2011. This movie was
a nice reminder of the great things about that silly spy show.

**Battle Angel Alita**

I read this comic when I was younger, and it’s kind of neat to see it made into
a live action film. I still can’t get over the uncanny valley eyes that Rose
Salazar’s character had, or the goofy "love story". Overall, this was a fun
action film.

**The Predator**

I’ve seen folks watching this on a bunch of planes in the past year or so, and
as a long-time fan of the Predator, I entered into it grudgingly. The first two
films were tight thrillers, but at this point, I can’t tell what the series
wants to be. If you can watch this for free, I guess it’s ok?

**Bad Times at the El Royale**

This was fun enough, with a pretty good ensemble cast. Nothing really stuck out
as excellent, and in a few ways it felt like a less-ambitious Tarantino film.

**The Quake**

A good reminder that disaster movies don’t need to have the glitz and glam of a
big budget Hollywood film. This sequel to The Wave was rather slowly-paced, but
exciting as it picked up steam.

**Killing of a Sacred Deer**

Wow, this was an eerie film. At this point I’ve enough of Yorgos Lanthimos’
films that I enter into them thinking “what’s the strange twist?” This film
delivered on that quite well. I love the strange, flat performance Lanthimos
actors provide—they lure you into this world with everything just _a bit_ off.
Also the young man in the film was _haunting_.

**First Reformed**

I went into this movie thinking "it's about religion and maybe climate change".
That covers it to a degree, but beyond that is so much truth and sadness. This
was a grim, beautiful film that struck me right at the core—both as an
ex-religious person, and someone who often mourns for the end of life for so
many folks effected by climate change. The movie, at it's core, asks if there's
any forgiveness for our destruction of the planet, for our destruction of
humanity. I don't have an answer to that question. This film however, was
excellent.

**The Lobster**

I can now say that I have indeed considered the Lobster. After seeing The
Favourite earlier this year, I decided to go back to watch Yorgos Lanthimos‘
other films. I’m glad I did. This was fantastic.

**The Ceremony (儀式)**

A bizarre 70s Japanese film about family, duty, and incest. Reading about this
film, it seems like much of it was meant to be an indictment of the older
generation, as well as the younger generation’s unwillingness to speak out
against tradition. As a film, it’s truly strange, but also brutal in its
methodical breakdown of the protagonist.

**Hobbs & Shaw**

A very silly buddy comedy. They talk about balls a bit too often for a movie
with two 50 year old protagonists, but it was fun at times. There’s very little
connection between this and Fast & Furious, but if you like Stratham & The Rock,
you’ll have fun.

**The Farewell**

I cried a lot during this film. Awkwafina did a fantastic job, and it's cool to
see a major US release mostly in Mandarin. If you've recently lost a
grandparent, or have gone through family illness, this might just hit you really
hard.

**Once Upon a Time in Hollywood**

This was a very strange movie, even by Tarentino's standards. A mix of fake show
clips, stories of a man and his valet, and glimpses into the Manson family. I
laughed quite a bit, and generally found this movie to be a blast.

**A Vigilante**

This was hard to watch. It was very well done, and intensely paced, but the
abuse in the films was painful. There’s a grim morality in this film, and a
certain catharsis in seeing abusers punished, but fuck.

**Thoroughbreads**

A fantastically creepy film about ennui and friendship. I loved it.

**Spiderman: Far from Home**

This is exactly what I want from a superhero movie: fun. The stakes were much
smaller than an Avengers movie, despite this film happening in the aftermath of
both the “blip” and many deaths, and that’s a good thing. Instead of
world-changing events, we got to enjoy Peter and his classmates goofing around
in Europe, and the zany world of Mysterio. I loved this movie. The action was
exciting, and the jokes were silly and fun.

**Hospitalitié (歓待)**

A strange movie reminiscent of a short story I read years ago where. house
guests slowly take over a family’s home. It’s dark, funny, and a poignant
commentary on xenophobia.

**Midsommar**

Wow. What a gorgeous, twisted, wild film. From the music to the ultra-bright
summer of it all, I loved this movie. If you’re quite squeamish, give it a pass.
Otherwise, skål!

**Force Majeure**

A slow burn of a movie. Largely, this is about a family, and a father who is
kind of a shit. Tormund from GoT shows up. Lots of skiing. Grey fog. Fin.

**Ralph Breaks the Internet**

This was super cute, with a nice mix of weird jokes and internet references.
It’s wild how many amazing actors they got to join in the strange fun. If you
liked the first film, you’ll enjoy the new one.

**X-Men: Dark Phoenix**

This movie wasn't as bad as critics have said, which isn't exactly a ringing
endorsement. Out of the[ two
treatments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Last_Stand) of the Dark
Phoenix, I think this one was better. The story was a bit odd, but overall, it
was fun and a lot of shit blew up. B- summer pap.

**Starfish**

A largely solo trek through grief, loneliness, and the end of the world. The
soundtrack to Starfish was excellent, as was the performance of Ginny Gardner.
Without spoiling anything, it’s best to say this movie goes in interesting
directions and is shot beautifully.

**Wandering Earth**

This is the second-highest grossing film in Chinese cinematic history. I’ve
heard about this book for a while, and conceptually it’s interesting to think
about the Earth moving instead of colony ships leaving, but it’s frustrating
that Chinese censors meant that the themes of the film are somewhat limited. The
end result felt more like The Core than Star Wars, and overall it was rather
disappointing.

**John Wick 3**

Ridiculous from start to finish. The fights were fun, the plot moved forward at
a fast clip, and this is one of my favorite silly action franchise.

**Lego Movie: Part 2**

Fun, but didn’t match up to the sheer weird joy of the first movie.

**Detective Pikachu**

Hilarious and so, so fun. This was definitely a kids movie, but aimed solidly at
kids who’re 28-35 now—my generation has the funds to relive our childhoods in
cinema. I played a few Pokémon games, and watched the cartoon for a little while
in middle school, and seeing all of the Pokémon I know flitting around the
screen was a hoot. Ryan Reynolds did some fantastic Pikachu voice acting,
matched by the incredible CGI of his fur. One of the sillier, funnier movies
I’ve seen in a minute. “My clues!”

**Burning**

It’s been years since I read the story that this movie was inspired by, so I
barely remember it. The pacing of Burning was slow, but each shot was artful,
and each scene a strange delight. Also, the ambling, slightly clueless
protagonist seemed to fit right in to Murakami world.

**Arctic**

This was in a really intense movie about how fucking cold it can get in the
Arctic, and how scary it is to be crashed there. I like to think that this is
somehow an extension of the Hannibal universe, and that in order to escape
capture he became a pilot.

**Avengers:Endgame**

This was like three movies jammed into one. It was fine, but I hope they stop
doing the massive super hero stuff for a while.

**Hagazussa**

Bizarre and utterly obsessed with liquids. Hard to watch, but also beautiful at
times.

**Still Walking**

A delightful meditation on family. I watched an earlier Koreeda movie called
[Nobody Knows](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_Knows_(2004_film)) just
after college, and it destroyed me. I mostly forgot about this director until
Shoplifters last year, and damn, I loved that film too. I think i only have the
emotional wherewithal to watch something he made every few months, but each time
I dive into his world, there’s an incredible depth to how he shows the small
ways we love and lose each other. Also it’s wild to see You-san in an acting
role, and not on the Terrace House couch.

**Little**

I don’t know where to start with this weird mess of a movie. It was super funny
at times, but left a lot on the cutting floor, had an utterly bizarre trans
“joke”, and the worst driving scenes I’ve seen. At the same time, it was goofy,
cute, and a man behind us loudly said, “that’s her when she was little”.

**Glass**

Well, I’ve finished Shyamalan’s weird comic trilogy. I remember watching
Unbreakable in the theater at the mall near my house as a kid. I’d don’t know if
that mall even exists anymore, but for a while, you could go to the arcade
downstairs, and then watch a movie in the theater near the food court. I was
straight-up enamored with Shyamalan at the time. Sixth Sense was fresh on my
mind, and Unbreakable was bizarre, but hinted at something wild. Subsequent
movies took this M. Night from a must watch icon, to an amusing auteur, and I
think that’s great. The Happening is a movie I deeply love, but this trilogy
never really lived up to either the mystery or weirdness of his best work. I
think in an effort to make a meta-comic movie, he made something that ultimately
doesn’t deliver much past a so-so premise that heroes _do_ exist. Which, is
fine, but isn’t “he was dead the whole time,” or “the plants!”

**The Night is Short, Walk on Girl**

This movie is gorgeous, which is to be expected from one of [Yusuke
Nakamura’s](https://www.amazon.com/ART-BOOK-NOW-Yusuke-Nakamura/dp/4864103844)
works. The plot is pretty bonkers, and includes everything from strange gods,
rare alcohols, and a collection of Classical Japanese porn. If you like this,
you might also love [Tatami
Galaxy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tatami_Galaxy) from the same folks.
There’s a certain spiritual similarity to Tampopo in this film’s over-the-top
appreciation for food and drinks too.

**Tampopo**

This was a really fun movie about how amazing food can be. Tons of literal and
figurative porn scenes about noodles, eggs, and more. The western film style is
kinda wacky and silly, but the overall tone was interesting. I was a bit out of
it when I watched this film, so I missed some of it, but likely this'll be a
rewatch.

**Us**

Super spooky. I don’t want to spoil anything, but the combination of very good
dad jokes, incredibly talented actors, and tight pacing kept this film feeling
scary and fun throughout. There’s twists and turns, and a very good boat name or
two. See this movie. I’m stoked we get to see more of Peele’s work in the
future.

**Prospect**

What a cool movie. This tense space flick proved that you can do a lot of sci-fi
stuff with less budget. I love media about shitty tech, and this is kind of
“what happens when you’re a skint space prospector” angle down pat. This
could’ve been a weird Cowboy Bebop live action, but instead tackled the idea
from a different angle. Sophie Thatcher rules, too. Wherever this was shot, it
was gorgeous.

**Captain Marvel**

Super fun! Brie Larson made for a very compelling super hero, and I love Goose
with my whole heart. The 90s throwback setting was a delight, along with its
soundtrack. I’m stoked to see what this sets up for future Marvel films, and
hopeful that we see the Skrull again (please show up in Runaways).

**Flavors of Youth**

An alright film about the things we leave behind as we grow older, and the
tastes and regrets we have. Most of this film is set in China, which is an
interesting place to hear all the characters speak Japanese. There are three
vignettes, and none really tugged my heartstrings, but it was still a well done
movie.

**Anna and the Apocalypse**

A high-school musical with zombies. I really don’t like musicals, to be honest.
I’d heard good things about this one though, and wanted to give it a chance. The
cast is doing a pretty good job throughout, though the relatively
one-dimensional characters of the “hot jock” and the “asshole headmaster” are
schlocky. This movie mostly made me want to watch Sean of the Dead again, which
used rock music to better effect.

**Polar**

Mads Mikkelsen got his Takeshi Kitano take-no-prisoners action role. This movie
was adapted from a comic, and it feels just like a comic, down to the choppy
dialogue, fast-paced action, and dead-simple plot. It’s kinda fun, if you can
get over the copious amounts of cartoonish murder.

**Piercing**

Weird. I read this book probably 10 years ago, and enjoyed it. The movie is a
lighter adaptation, as it’s trickier to capture internal dialogue on film. Mia
Wasikowska is outstanding as usual. I also enjoyed the general 70s aesthetic,
and the cool selection of lingerie. This film only clocks in at about an hour
and twenty minutes, but manages to build and release tension a few times.

**Spy**

I don't know why I slept on this film. I guess I like Paul Fieg movies? This is
delightful fare from Melissa Mcarthy, and a solid supporting cast.

**Close**

Noomi Rapace is a badass bodyguard in this short, high-action thriller. The
“rich girl who eventually learns she needs help” is a long-standing trope, but
it’s plays well here. This movie takes place in a weird parallel reality wherein
everyone uses Blackberrys. Shout out to Indira Varma too, who was great in
Luther, Game of Thrones, and now as a potentially treacherous stepmom.

**IO**

Another great eco-pocalypse movie. Limited cast and locations, but a cool
premise overall. This movie was short, but definitely hit many of my speculative
fiction check marks. I want to ride an ATV now.

**Vox Lux**

I loved the intense opening scenes of this film, and the scrolling credits—I’ve
rarely seen something like this, and it felt brutal and fresh. Sadly the rest of
the film felt like an idea that they forgot to film. Was she the devil? Didn’t
explore that. Single mom? Didn’t explore that. There was so much buildup with no
payoff. Terrorists? Nah. Long song b-roll? Yep. Even Sia couldn’t be bothered to
record anything great for this film. Missed opportunity. This could‘be been
Wicked and Divine, the movie.

**Destroyer**

Another film with Tony Kebbell—seeing him in this after seeing him in Hurricane
Heist was a wild ride. I think his American accent got better. Also, Kusama
seemed pretty obsessed with Kidman’s face throughout this film. This was a
intense sad cop/revenge film, with elements from many old sad cop guy
films—transformed into something new by letting the old cop be a woman. I really
appreciated the Halt & Catch Fire alumni, as well as the always delightful
Tatiana Maslany. This movie felt like a different era, and painted LA in a grim,
dusty light.

**Shoplifters**

What a fantastic film. In some ways this reminded me of the anime Tokyo
Godfathers—which is also about a group of underground folks taking in a child.
The way Shoplifters weaved chosen family in with delightful vignettes and
outstanding performances by two children was masterful. This felt like a Japan
that rarely appears in cinema—a group of folks struggling with poverty, and not
sure how to be part of a society that seems to expect them to join in. I will
probably rewatch this, and highly recommend it.

**Hurricane Heist**

I knew going in that this would be a bonkers film, having listened to the How
Did This Get Made episode about it, but wow. Everyone in this film except for
Maggie Grace is from England or Australia, and their accents are absurd. I feel
like everyone got drunk, decided to use an “Alabama accent” and then a movie
happened. Nothing that happened made sense, but also it was a hoot.

**Assasination Nation**

I’m still not sure what I saw. I _think_ this aims to be a cautionary tale about
mob rule, privacy, and misogyny. It’s brutal, graphic, and so full of -isms, I
can’t say I recommend it. It’s wild that this movie played in theaters. I’m
kinda stoked Hari Nef got to be a mean teen trans lady. By the end there’s a
revenge bloodbath that I can’t tell if I was meant to find cathartic, or sad.
This is definitely the most misanthropic and nihilistic movie I've seen in
years.

## 2018 {#2018}

**Hearts Beat Loud**

I cried through a lot of this, because the dad was so good. A+ always here for
rebellious lesbian daughters with amazing musical talent and cool girlfriends.
Also here for every person in the cast, and a random Jeff Tweedy cameo. Also
Best American Girl was a dope song/Puberty 2 was an amazing album. I will
rewatch this.

**Bird Box**

Spooky fun times. A bit of Blindness, a bit of the Happening, and a bit of
Sandra Bullock. This was a star vehicle, with lots of randomly awesome small
characters. Worth a watch, especially if you’re already a Netflix person.

**Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse**

Such a fun, silly movie. I recently played the Spider-Man PS4 game, so it was
cool to see Miles return. Also, I’m a fan of Spider-Gwen, and I’m stoked she got
a movie appearance. The whole theater was cracking up for over half of the film,
and then it got a little serious and action-y. I really hope they make another
one of these. The animation was wild, and super original too.

**The Favourite**

A lesbian triumph. Olivia Coleman had me laughing constantly with her
performance as the queen, and Rachel Weiss & Emma Stone were a delight. This
movie was a bizarre, hilarious, and strangely shot film; using fisheye lenses,
and lots of smooth pans on a rail made for a truly odd experience. There was
quite a bit of creative anachronism, and some very adorable ducks. Easily one of
the best movies I saw this year.

**The Equalizer: 2**

This is apparently the first sequel Denzel has ever made. I’ve loved the genre of
Denzel as an ultraviolent avenging angel ever since I saw Man on Fire. Some
folks may prefer John Wick, and granted, those movies have a great style, but
damn, the Equalizer is a series I hope to see more of in the future.

**The Death of Stalin** (rewatch)

It’s the season for rewatching films.

**Slice**

Super goofy horror film with lots of great folks. I think B movies can only
rarely be made great from the start, and this one could’ve used a little less
effort.

**The Fast & the Furious** (rewatch)

A few friends hadn’t watched this before, so we drank a bit, and had a
rip-roaring good time seeing this again. Everyone is decked-out in the most late
90s gear, the camera work is bonkers, and the cars are cool, but painted like
awful hot wheels. I _love_ this series.

**Hereditary**

Granted, the central twist was spoiled for me, but so much of this movie felt
joyless. Theoretically this movie should’ve been right up my alley, but honestly
I would’ve rather rewatched the VVitch for the umpteenth time.

**Widows**

This was one of my favorite movies of the year. Wow. A all badass lady heist
movie with actual stakes! Everyone delivers in this film, and it was a hoot. A+

**Crazy Rich Asians**

This was a schlocky romcom about a very rarefied set of Chinese Singaporeans. It
was fun enough, and now both of the people I saw it with want to flood the aisle
of a building during their wedding. Moms are a lot.

**Girl with a Dragon Tattoo** (rewatch)

My partner hasn’t seen these, and I would watch them again basically whenever,
so here we are.

**Ant Man and the Wasp** (rewatch)

Just as delightful the second go-round. More fun superhero movies please.

**Skyscraper**

So, so ridiculous and terrible... but also kind of great? Like, what if Die Hard
wasn't as good, and had the Rock in Hong Kong? I watched this so I could listen
to this week's How Did This Get Made, and I am glad I did.

**The Girl in the Spider's Web**

We're on our third Lisbeth actress, and while Claire Foy more than filled the
shoes of Rooney Mara, the same can't quite be said for whoever replaced Daniel
Craig. This was a fun, twisty movie, that was inadvertently stressful for my
partner because of all the snow and ice driving. Lisbeth continues to deliver
her brand of justice, while "then Lisbeth hacks the thing" is a major plot
device. Kudos to all the lesbians in this, and the giant case of dildos. Fun
movie.

**The Guilty**

A wild single-room movie, that takes place completely over the phone. I love the
narrative device, and the slow, dread-filled pacing. The movie largely takes
place in your own imagination, helped along by excellent foley, and voice
acting.

**The First Purge**

Yow, what a good mess. I don't know why I love the Purge films, and to be
honest, this one felt a little too real. However, I watched this on Halloween,
so it fit my needs of a spooky, scary movie.

**Halloween (2018)**

This was goofy and fun, while still being a twisty thriller. Ultimately, these
are morality tales about private property ownership, lol. A+ to Jamie Lee
Curtis, and also all the random bit players. Definitely a good popcorn flick
with friends.

**Halloween**

A spooky throwback to get ready for the sequel. I guess they made a bunch of
these and they were all garbage, and the new movie aims to erase them. I _think_
somehow the only one I'd seen was Season of the Witch, which is the 3rd movie in
the original set. The 70s were a weird time, and the amount of nudity random
"gotta take my clothes off" is just yikes. Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job. I'm
hoping the pacing of the new film is more up to modern standards though, because
dang, did this feel dated and slow in a lot of ways.

**Hotel Artemis**

From the preview, I assumed this would be a John Wick knockoff, but it was fun
in its own right. Lots of action, Jenny Slate, and a wide array of solid actors.
The future is a dismal one, but hey, that checks out.

**Beirut**

What if John Hamm's Mad Men character was a state department guy turned
negotiator? 70s Beirut is a trip in the way it's presented, and knowing a little
history, this seems like a wild but semi-accurate portrayal of all the folks who
fought over Lebanon during and after the civil war. This is a tonally dark
political thriller, and I dug it.

**Venom**

What a perfectly odd anti-hero film. I was a big Venom fan as a kid, and this
movie delivered everything I wanted in a Venom movie. Fuck the haters, this is a
hoot. I don't think this should win any prizes for _cinema_ but it's fun, and
provided lots of awkward laughs. The action was exciting, and I can't wait for a
sequel full of _carnage_.

**Sicario: Day of the Solado**

Another ridiculous action film about "the cartels" that I can't honestly tell is
meant to make folks dislike the US or root for us. If you want to watch
Cable/Thanos run around and shoot things, this is probalby a good movie for you.
I don't find these very clever, but mostly I wish we got an Equalizer-style
movie focused on Benecio Del Toro's character. While I'm hoping, perhaps Demián
Bichir can be in the third movie.

**Mandy**

A weirdo pyschadelic mess of a movie. I hate that a woman's death is used as a
catalyst, but beyond that this is a bloody, ridiculous revenge flick. The music
is great throughout and perhaps we were all delirious, but my theater laughed
quite a bit.

**Dawn of the Dead** (2004/Rewatch)

I could watch this every year. This is an excellent remake of an excellent
zombie film. Everyone gives their all, and so many of the deaths, kills, and
twists are perfect. A+ work from before Zach Snyder made cruddy films.

**A Simple Favor**

What a silly, fun movie. It ends up in kind of a weird, messy state by the end,
as if Feig is like "wait, what if they don't remember I made Bridesmaids?!?",
but I generally enjoyed seeing Blake Lively be a cool babe, while Anna Kendrick
does her thing. All the side-characters were fun, and even though it felt long,
it was also consistently enjoyable.

**Blindspotting**

This is the third movie I've seen this year that was shot in Oakland, and I
loved it. There is so much intensity, and so many parts that made me hold my
breath, but everyone in this, especially Daveed Diggs, just showed-up and did an
outstanding job. The criticism of gentrification in this felt more present and
painful than Sorry to Bother You, and the raw emotional energy between family
and friends here was so good.

**The Nun**

Lol, this ridiculous series. My friend got me into this while I was recovering
from a surgery last year by asking me to watch all the preceding movies before
we went to see one of the Annabelle ones. This series delivers spooky times,
jump-scares, and a universe completely devoid of a loving god. I'm always down
for a movie where the evil folks win, and this series is suitably unclear about
who actually comes out on top, so I just claim it for the demons.

**The Endless**

What a bizarre, fantastic film. I loved the world and magic of this movie, as
well as the general sense of eerie inevitably. I'm excited to see the previous
film as well. The shots of this film are a mix of dutch angles, handheld, and
some neat CGI. There's quite a bit of upsetting stuff in this film, but it's
also a fun ride.

**47 Meters Down**

Mandy Moore has never scuba-dived, but on a vacation to Mexico, her asshole
friend convinces her to scuba in a cage with sharks to forget a man. It goes
about as poorly as you’d think. I loved every claustrophobic minute of this.
Fuck the ocean, I’m sticking to the rivers and the lakes that I’m used to.

**Mary and the Witch's Flower**

A cute anime about a young girl who stumbles into the world of witchcraft. Very reminiscent of Howl's Moving Castle, but with a less encompassing world.

**Den of Thieves**

A heist movie with a pretty solid cast. Gerard Butler plays a shitty, dirty cop
well. He was definitely believable as "the guy who treats everyone like shit,
but we're supposed to believe he is a very good dad who just loves his
daughters." The plot was decently executed, but it's mostly just a movie with
lots of bro posturing and guns. Not a bad way to spend a couple hours on the
couch.

**Masterminds**

A ridiculous heist comedy with Zach Galafanakis, Kristen Wiig, and Jason
Sudekis. It's about as ridiculous as you would imagine. A+ romp. Lots of quality
physical comedy.

**Book Club**

Watched this on a whim with a couple friends, and it was kinda great? I love Candace Bergen from the Murphy Brown days, and hope I look as good as Diane Keaton when I'm older. Silly popcorn fun. Also I guess I own it now because it wasn't available to rent.

**The Meg**

Wow. This is my new favorite sea-based movie. What an epically hilarious film.
A+ good job everyone.

**Mission Impossible Fallout**

A wild, nearly 3 hour ride through a comical series of twists and beards. I
laughed out loud often, both at the unearned gravitas, and actual jokes. I love
this series like Tom Cruise loves being an action hero: deeply, and
passionately.

**Ready Player One**

I blame my friend Mark, because he chose this for us to watch. It was just as
bad as I thought it would be, but blessedly we could make good jokes throughout.

**Drive Angry**

There are probably worse Nic Cage movies, but this is the worst one I've seen.
Every scene is painfully bad.

**Tomb Raider**

Fun, and very surprisingly entertaining for a video game movie. Lots of "oh, I
could see how this would play in the game," scenes. Alicia Vikander is a much
better Lara Croft too, imo.

**Sorry to Bother You**

This is the movie Idiocracy wishes it were. Sorry to Bother You skewers tech
culture, bay-area poverty, racial injustice, and so much more. Throughout,
Tessa, Lakeith, and the rest of the cast deliver awesome performances. A mix of
chilling and laugh-inducing. One of the best films I've seen this year.

**Tragedy Girls**

What a wild, fucked-up movie about social media, murder, and friendship. Don't
do it for the gram.

**I, Tonya**

Finally watched this with a friend, and wow, it was good but full of very
violent abuse stuff. Growing up in the 80s/90s, Tonya Harding was in a lot of
news, but this definitely filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of her story.

**Villainess**

What a wonderfully bonkers movie. It kicks off with wild first-person murder
fest, and just goes off-the-rails from there. One of the bloodier and wilder
action films I've seen in a long time. Loved it.

**The Incredibles 2**

Watched this a few hours after the first one. The animation has gotten a LOT
better, even though the first one honestly aged pretty well, since they didn't
try to make it photorealistic. The plot was ridiculous again, and they
definitely leaned hard into the "men are bad at childcare" shit that I suspected
they would. Fun enough though anyways.

**The Incredibles**

The animation holds up surprisingly well for a few year-old movie, even if the
plot depends on some pretty annoying misogynist tropes. I watched this to prep
for the new movie, and overall it was a fun, if ridiculous, movie.

**Ant Man & the Wasp**

This was a hoot. Very silly, and pretty PG, but above all else, this felt like a
comic movie. I'd compare this to Spiderman Homecoming or a less stylish Thor
Ragnarok. Great summer night movie.

**Sicario**

What a wild movie, in which I needed to completely suspend all of my feelings
about America, the "drug war" and Thanos. If you can attempt to not emotionally
connect to the actual monsters in this movie, it's kinda fun in a "tense film
where things blow up" kind of way.

**Gemini**

Lesbian murder mystery? Yes. This was fun, even if the music felt super weird at
times. Good bangs. Cool cars. A movie where men are the worst. Also this seems
consistent with the choices and habits of geminis, so, lol. _shots fired_.

**Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom**

Lol, this movie was absurd. They rushed off the island and so many of the
subplots never really paid off? I can't forget that Pratt is a conservative, and
I didn't really care much about anyone in this film, except for the dinosaurs. I
guess I was rooting for the dinosaurs, and I figure they probably came out
ahead.

**Oh Lucy!**

This movie ruled! The world feels pretty rough these days, and this movie
doesn't shy away from difficult topics, but the overarching feeling of Oh Lucy
is a kind and happy one. It was also cool seeing an actor I've watched in lots
of Kiyoshi Kurasawa films show up in a very rad role.

**Ocean's 8**

All. Ladies. Heist. A+. I hope everyone involved in this comes out as gay.
Points for literally every outfit, and double points for Rhianna's
devil-may-care overalls, and Cate Blanchett's Carol-as-a-Timelord character.

**xx**

Terrible title unless everyone involved had to get a karyotype test to be involved. Most of the horror was related to having kids, which meant this movie hit me hard, because kids are the worst and deeply frightening on the best days.

**Unlocked**

I'm a sucker for middling spy movies, and Noomi Rapace, so I now own this film.
It wasn't great, but it was fun, and dammit, sometimes that's all I need. TIL
Michael Douglas is still around.

**Red Sparrow**

I will never believe for one second that the protagonist would fall for Joel
Edgerton's bland spyman. For some reason, I expected this movie to be set during
the cold war, but instead it's vaguely now. This had more sexual assault than I
expected too, which is a fucking bummer. The saving grace in this film is that
by and large Jennifer Lawrence kills or beats all the men in the movie. I can
only hope she gets cast in more movies where she doesn't have to participate in
misogynist porn first.

**Appropriate Behavior**

This was a fun movie about being a Persian Bisexual woman in NYC. Shirin goes
through a major breakup, then struggles to date, and heal, while dealing with a
family she doesn't think will understand her queerness, and the strange world of
the NYC queer and poly scene. I laughed out loud during a lot of this, even as I
scratched my head at the confusing references to trans guys—like, why are they a
joke? Overall, I dug this movie, and hope the director/writer Desiree makes more
films soon.

**Solo**

This was probably tied with Last Jedi for my least favorite of the new Star
Wars, but I liked it better than pretty much any of the old or prequel ones. It
was fun, had a few rad women, and didn't go overboard on "remember this?"
fanservice. I laughed a few times, and I'm hoping they make sequels.

**Deadpool 2**

As fun as Avengers: Infinity War was boring and meh. Full of silly jokes. There
were definitely jokes that were in really poor taste, but pretty much what I
expected.

**Avengers: Infinity War**

This movie tried to tie together too many disparate stories, to bland effect.
The attempt at some sort of emotional climax was a big wet fart, despite ten
people in the theater I was in yelling at the screen. Like, _spoilers_ they'll
all be back, bc Disney isn't going to kill off their money-makers. Go rewatch
Black Panther of Thor Ragnarok, or like, spend 3 hours outside instead.

**In the Fade**

One of the saddest movies I've seen in a long time. It's gorgeous, well-shot,
and soundtracked, but phew, what a brutal movie about the evils of nazism, and
racism.

**Geostorm**

A trash movie in the best way. If you liked watching Jake Gylenhall run from ice
in The Day After Tomorrow, and people saying "zap!" and "geostorm!", then this
movie is for you. Continues the trend of big-budget action films being largely
targeted for non-US success, but that means we also get some cool co-stars.

**A Quiet Place**

A "good christian family" who _loves_ gender roles has to be _vewwwwwy quiet_ so
they don't get eaten by some kind of creatures. This movie was silly as fuck.
Every time the monster was on screen, someone had to pantomime "be quiet," as if
the entire movie hadn't been quiet. Also _spoilers_ but how the fuck do you get
pregnant if you know that a baby is going to make loud baby noises and get your
family killed? And _where did they fuck?_ Anyways, this is a hate-watch.

**The Descent**

Another "maybe these are bad people" everything-goes-wrong movie. This was a
rewatch, and yet, the cave scenes still had me feeling super claustrophobic. It
didn't help that I was in the middle of a middle row on a plane to Portland from
Amsterdam when I watched it.

**Cabin Fever**

I can't tell if this was the original, or if this was a remake, but either way,
it's nice to watch annoying and awful people fall apart. This is a theme of the
previous and next movie.

**The Ritual**

A very good "get lost in the woods" movie. Bad things happen to unlikeable men.
A+.

**The Death of Stalin**

Super dark comedy. It has that abusive asshole Jeffrey Tambor, but otherwise is
full of hilariously weird old men. If you like Veep or In the Thick of It, this
is a must-watch.

**Blade**

_rewatch_ Wesley Snipes is a half-vampire vampire hunter. It rules.

**Wrinkle in Time**

I'd recommend listening to [this
podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/podcasts/still-processing-we-dont-love-everything-made-by-black-people-and-thats-ok.html)
after you see the movie. It was very, very disney, and they burned through
everything pretty fast without a lot of wonder. Really glad that the god stuff
was gone, but I think they could have jettisoned Calvin too without losing
anything.

**Thelma**

A great movie about being queer, growing up Christian, and maybe having super
powers. Relateable AF. Highly recommended.

**Annihilation**

What a wild movie. I read these books back in 2014 when they were released in a
frenzy. I was pretty constantly afraid of the house I was staying in, as I was
pretty well disturbed by the book. It had the kind of sneaky quality that gets
in your head. The movie did a brisker job of telling a similar story, but I
enjoyed it. I'll probalby see this again, and I'm very curious if they'll try to
make more.

**Lost Boys**

I hadn't seen this movie for a long time, but recently
[Imogen](https://imogenwatchesclassicfilms.wordpress.com) watched and talked
about it, so my roommate and I sat down for a revisit. It held up. There's
something fantastic about watching these very gay vampire boys run around and be
punk teens. Listen to Imogen's podcast if you can, bc she says everything I'd
wanna cover. Oh, and watch this movie.

**Black Panther**

Holy shit. I thought this movie would be good, but I had no idea how amazing it
would be. Action like woah, a solid plot that doesn't dig into origin story over
and over like other Marvel films, and amazing set and costume design. The array
of talented actors in this film is unbelievable. This is one of the best films
of 2018. No doubt.

**The Cloverfield Paradox**

I'd heard a lot of "this movie isn't good" from folks who hate fun, I guess. It
was fun, and a pretty decent "stuff goes wrong in space" movie. I LOVE
Cloverfield and even though I was mad at the gendered threat of violence that
permeated the entirety of 10 Cloverfield Lane, I still enjoyed bits of that too.
The Cloverfield universe is a wild one that I really enjoy. See this if you have
Netflix, like seeing WoC protagonists, or like Cloverfield movies.

**I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore**

Elijah Wood is doing his all in this movie, as is Melanie Lynskey. This goes off
the rails midway through, and becomes a thrillride, but keeps up the laughs.
Also, yay for a movie that's set in Portland.


**Hunt for the Wilderpeople**

Ahhh, this ruled! Sam Neil, and the kid are spectacular. Taika has a lovely
cameo as a bizarre priest. This might end up being the best movie I see this
year, and it had me laughing pretty consistently throughout.

**The Raid**

My second viewing of this movie since I saw it in theaters in Berkeley. I love
how rad and amazing this tower-escape film is. The fight scenes and film style
is so kinetic, and carries you through the film. There's not a lot in the way of
plot, but some of it feels like a Die Hard homage.

**The Foreigner**

Jackie Chan vs Irish James Bond. This movie kinda ruled. Jackie Chan is
fantastic, even at 63, at just dominating the screen with his personality and
action. This is definitely a more subdued and serious role than many of his more
famous films, but he shows up and is great. Parts of this reminded me of taken,
and others of _name a political thriller_, but overall I really enjoyed this
movie.

**Battle of the Sexes**

I'd heard good things, and this was pretty fun to watch. The lesbian storyline
was surprisingly compelling, and very well-done. I'm mad that Adidas didn't
reissue BJK's signature shoe when this movie came out though. It's a good shoe.
Steve Carrell seemed like many of his other characters in this, but whatever...
Billy Riggs was an ass, and they do a good job of showing that.

**Murder on the Orient Express**

Everyone is acting _so hard_ in this, and yet the result is a mess. That said,
I'd watch this again just to see Branaugh's ridiculous mustache. 10/10 mustache.
I saw this in Japan, so I had a beer and french fries to make it slightly
better, and pre-roll video that repeated "NO NO NO" in English to admonish us
for even considering texting or talking.

## 2017 {#2017}

_this list is super truncated because i forgot keep it until july_

**Life**

Everyone forgets their training, acts like an ass, and gets munched by aliens.
It was entertaining in a schadenfreude way.

**Moonlight**

Cried through most of this. It's about growing up black & gay, with a
neurodiverse mom. It's beautiful, intense, and in my top five movies I've ever
seen. Incredible.

**Get Out**

At times hilarious, and others biting AF. I really loved this movie. A
pitch-perfect callout of "good white folks", like we often are.

**Alien Covenant**

Aliens rule. This movie ruled. Kenny Powers flies a spaceship, and new Ridley is
solid. Also Magneto is creepy AF in this.

**Logan**

It's like Wolverine, but better, because he's old. Also this has Rictor, who was
gay in the comics with Shatterstar. Super entertaining.

**Fast & Furious 8**

Haven't seen one of these? Ready to live your life a quarter-mile at a time?
Start at 1, then watch 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8. I think. Anyways, this is bonkers in
a perfect way.

**Blame!**

A anime movie? Yea, this series by Nihei is kinda rad, and there's cool killer
lady. It's 3D animated, which is kinda the worst, but it doesn't look horrible
in this.

**Rogue One**

Ah, this was super good. A+ characters, fun action, and a lack of space incest!
Also the robot was comic relief without being a jar jar.

**The Autopsy of Jane Doe**

Brian Cox from that other X-Men movie and also Rushmore is a morgue-guy, like
those cuties from Six Feet Under... except spookier. Also I think the other guy
was Spiderman.

**Lego Batman**

Gob Bluth is the bat. This movie is hilarious. Bonus points if you're a DC
comics nerd, or just enjoy fun.

**Train to Busan**

Seriously one of the best zombie movies I've seen in a long time. Also I love
trains, and this is the best train movie since Snowpiercer.

**Aliens**

Ugh, this sequel to Alien was so good, and still is so good. RIP cool cat, but
yay for all the rad ladies in this. Also Bishop is the only ok robot in this
series.

**Guardians of the Galaxy 2**

Overall, pretty entertaining. Gomorra is cool as always. Baby Groot was less
awful than I expected, and hey! Kurt Russell space dad.

**John Wick 2**

So, this is more Keanu as a vengeful Denzel Washington-esque character, but not
as good. I liked this movie, but also Man on Fire did it better. Well shot
though! And there's at least a nod towards ammo being a thing.

**Kong: Skull Island**

Wow, they just told Samuel L. Jackson to be his one character, which is a great
character. Bonus points for Steve Brule.

**Tremors**

"Featuring Kevin Bacon from Footloose" as the least convincing outdoor working
man in a movie, ever. He and his boyfriend can't leave town, so they end up
fighting giant worms. This movie is super euphemistic, hilarious, and the best
role Reba has ever had.

**Shin Godzilla**

A fantastic look at how modern bureaucracy and posturing can get in the way of
stopping a giant lizard. Too bad they don't show the environmental devastation
wrought by eschewing safety checks.

**Your Name**

A super cute, super straight story of love through time. Imagine if the Lake
House was better, and didn't have Keanu. It's basically this.

**The Girl with All the Gifts**

Another great zombie movie, with a super cute protagonist. Cute kid zombies are
great.

**Raw**

This is literally what happens if you break vegan.

**Prometheus**

Had to rewatch this after Covenant. Still perfect. Naomi Rapace could do her
taxes on film, and I'd probably be riveted. She rules.

**Justice League Dark**

I wanted this to be better. It was so-so, and seriously, _Swamp Thing_?

**The Heat**

A send-up of Lethal Weapon + every buddy cop film. Mcarthy and Bullock are
fantastic in this.

**Keanu**

I will watch this yearly, as it's one of the 4 movies I own. Get high, and watch
this movie about a kitten, and the men who love him.

**Wicker Man**

Nick Cage at his most unhinged. Well, close to it. My roommate hadn't seen this,
so I introduced her to this hilarious hellride.

**Neon Demon**

Don't get into modeling. It'll end badly. This movie was beautiful, gory, and
wild.

**Kubo**

I've enjoyed other movies from this studio more – Coraline for one – but this
was still fun.

**Baby Driver**

I'd avoided watching this because I hadn't read great things about it, save for
[this review by Matt
Haughey](https://15minutes.inthemorni.ng/baby-driver-was-fantastic-2acd21be54ba).
While I agree with him that the opening action scene was stellar, so were the
short films BMW made with greats like Wong Kar Wai a few years ago to sell cars.
I liked watching this film, but it's unfortunate that the men were
two-dimensional, and the women collapsed in on themselves, with no
characterization, or much motivation. I'd expected a bit more of Edgar Wright,
but on the upside, the musical cues were also quite good. I'm not fully sure if
this is a tribute to old McQueen movies, or what, but it was alright, but I
can't co-sign the _fantastic_ from the above. It was exciting, but the stakes
weren't ever high, because I never cared much about the protagonist, because I
was given no reason to care. We've seen chases before, parkour, car work. This
movie could've elevated them further, but it chose not to. I never believed
there really was jeopardy, because as the movie, and the news of the day makes
clear, "he's such a good boy," is something that will always apply to the white
male criminal.

**Valerian**

The short version is that this was very targetted towards a Chinese release,
partially due to the studio financing, and even Besson was [promoting it on
Weibo](http://chinafilminsider.com/valerian-city-thousand-planets-passes-china-censorship/).
I had a great time watching this movie, but it was pretty dang ridiculous, and
had super traditional and boring gender roles and "marriage is the best" kind of
crap. Still, the visuals were incredible, and it was a fun space romp.
Recommended.

**Secret Life of Pets**

I blame my friend Andy – they wanted to watch this because they were tired and
we thought it'd be cute. It was very cute, but also pretty silly. I dunno. Kids
probably loved it. There's some good cats.

**Atomic Blonde**

Charlize Theron as a queer badass assassin/spy? Sold. Because this is mainstream
Hollywood, of course that doesn't last, but still... this was a fun romp. A
summer movie devoid of substance, but thick and heavy with style and silliness.

**Flatliners**

Kiefer oozes weird attraction in this classic about chasing the meaning of life
by dying for minutes. I saw a trailer for the _sequel_ to this, I guess, with
Ellen Page, so I had to revisit the original. I loved it all over again. Spooky
and silly. And, to quote my roommate, "how many Baldwins are there?!"

**They're Watching**

This was goofy as hell, and was sort of a comedic Blair Witch in Moldova thing.
Near the end it takes a sharp left, and we were cracking up. Worth watching on
Netflix, perhaps?

**2012**

A beautifully terrible film by the guy who brought us The Day After Tomorrow. I
love a movie where we're led to believe that John Cusack is the best driver in
the world, and a writer-cum-action hero. I love watching this movie when I'm
camping, or hiking for a few days, because it's so ridiculous, and also it's
wild to watch the world end, however silly the movie.

**In This Corner of the World**

SO. MANY. TEARS. My friends and I sobbed through a lot of this film about the
atrocities of World War 2, especially the destruction the United States caused
in Japan. The movie follows a woman living in Hiroshima, then Kure, who grows up
in the 30s and 40s, and sees her friends and loved ones suffer during the war.
It's beautiful, hilarious at times, and sad. This movie is a shift on the view
that Grave of the Fireflies offers, but definitely in similar territory.

**The Visit**

Guessed the twist about 20 minutes into this movie and i'm really proud of that
because I'm usually the worst at figuring out where bad movies are headed. Don't
trust your grandparents. Don't send your kids anywhere. Don't ever clean your
oven.

**The Conjuring**

This was great, until the witch didn't win. I can't help but think these movies
are trying to get me to follow their lord and savior.

**The Conjuring 2**

Yep, these are definitely witnessing. A cool demon has a hard time with some
very awful British people. Watched both of these in quick succession to get to
see Annabelle 2 or whatever later on tonight.

**Annabelle: Creation**

This was a very silly movie with children making terrible choices. I don't think
dolls themselves are very scary, but Catholicism is definitely scary. Everyone
who gets hunted by the demon or whatever was also a practicing Catholic, so
maybe being a satanist or atheist would be some kinda ghost protection.

**Wall-E**

One of the best movies ever, and it's held up super well in animation and craft.
I love this robot.

**I think I watched a movie about a plague**

I was on a LOT of drugs for surgery, so I have no idea what this was called, but
I'm pretty sure I saw it before?

**The Happening**

This fucking movie is straight-up incredible. Mark Wahlberg at his best "I'm
just happy to be here," and a whole lot of incredibly banal deaths. Zooey
"Literal Beige Person" Deschanel is also in this for some reason. Anyways, I
love that this was one of the movies we all saw, hoping for the return of that
GOOD GOOD Sixth Sense action, and instead we got this beautiful god trash. Eat a
pound of desert pudding and cry about humanity. "I'm gonna give you... a math
riddle."

**IT**

Hadn't seen it, and wow what a silly joy. Not scary at all, but I'm definitely
even less trustworthy of Tim Curry now, I guess? Everyone is giving their all in
this movie.

**Wonder Woman**

Ok, I finally saw it. I literally couldn't stop thinking about Gal being part of
an anti-Palestian army, but once Chris Pine made me laugh by doing a bad German
accent. This movie bravely asks the question: "she's a goddess, but when will
she become super saiyan?" Not particularly into this movie.

**Spiderman: Homecoming**

This is the kind of superhero film that makes me smile. I think this is the best
reboot of the Spiderman franchise, and it is filled with silly, fun moments,
that emphasize the more joyful aspects of the character. I'm looking forward to
the next few. Marvel seems like they're just going to keep making better movies
than DC, save for the Nolan Batman movies. Speaking of Batman – the second best
modern Batman (Michael Keaton) also plays the Vulture in this movie. Go figure.
Anyways, this was a fun romp.

**Ingrid Goes West**

Everyone besides Dan is terrible in this movie, and Dan is hella co-dependent.
This is a biting satire of the lives folks live in pursuit of Instagram
perfection.

**Death Becomes Her**

Bruce Willis, with _hair_! Wow. Everything about this movie is perfect. Women
seeking eternal youth. Isabella Rossilini just oozing charisma and power.
Inexplicable wrestling manservants. Mincing Bruce Willis. The prothesis in this
movie is _hella_ Beetlejuice. I loved it.

**New IT**

I think I'm broken inside, because jump scares and all of the "scary" bits of
this film didn't phase me. It was at times pretty cute, but the misogyny and
against the only girl in the group was the scariest thing of all. I'm interested
to see what they do with the second part of this movie. The visuals were kinda
neat and well-done.

**Friend Request**

Wow, this movie was garbage. I ended up skipping through it because the first 20
minutes were so painful. 0 thumbs out of 20.

**The Hitman's Bodyguard**

Samuel L Jackson at 68 in The Hitman's Bodyguard is doing a better job than most
action guys half his age. What a goofy, fun movie. It's not particularly smart,
but it was a wonderful romp. A summer action movie through and through.

**Ghost in the Shell (with ScarJo & white-washing)**

The fashion was kinda neat, and some of the visuals were cool. The story seemed
worse than the anime though, and I can't tell if ScarJo can't act, or just
collected a paycheck. Bonus points to Beat Takeshi for just speaking Japanese
the entire time, unlike the rest of the characters. He's great. I hope he got
paid for this trash.

**xXx: The Return of Xander Cage**

Wow, this movie was over-the-top ridiculous. And the terrible coat was back from
the first movie. I think this canonically takes place in the Marvel universe,
because of Samuel L. Jackson. I have no idea why xXx uses "extreme sports"
people, soccer stars, and a DJ(?), but here we are. I love this very, very goofy
series, and bought this movie with a big grin when it was no longer available
for rent. Everyone is having a blast, and it's a multi-cultural cast that is
filled with neat folks.

**Blade Runner: 2046**

Damn. This was definitely one of my favorite movies this year. Every scene was
so beautiful, and skillfully art-directed. I loved that Mackenzie Davis (also
from the San Junipero, the Martian, & Halt & Catch Fire) was in this too.
Harrison Ford was spectacular, and somehow Ryan Reynolds didn't bother me. The
outfits ruled, and even though I wish there'd been more central roles for women,
the women that were in the film were neat. I'll own this, and watch it more than
once, for sure. Now, to find some of the outfits in the film...

**What Happened to Monday**

A movie with Noomi Rapace playing 7 different women? I'm in. Willem Dafoe was in
this too. Mostly this movie was a neat dystopia with lots of twists, and even
though Noomi Rapace wasn't quite up to Tatiana Maslany's Orphan Black
performance, it's still really, really well edited.

**Landline**

From the same creators as Obvious Child, which ruled, comes this movie about a
family in the 90s trying to keep from imploding. Jenny Slate is great in this,
and the sisterhood on display is pretty adorable. John Turturro does a great job
too.

**Colossal**

Oh, great, a movie about white people working out their alcoholism and
relationship issues while murdering folks in Korea. I dunno. This wasn't great.
Also damn girl, those bangs are LONG.

**Beyond the Gates**

Very silly movie about a VCR-based horror game that... is really happening. A
fun time for the spooky holidays.

**Pitch Black**

Vin's other, other series. Vin Diesel plays the same character, but this time,
he's in a _space_ black tank top, and his eyes glow because he can see in the
dark, I guess? There's a genderqueer-ish person in this film, but I checked and
the actress is definitely a straight and feminine-presenting woman now. Was
hoping Jack grew up to be a genderfucking weirdo cool kid.

**Fried Green Tomatoes**

This was charming and cute. It wasn't as gay as I wanted it to be, but was gayer
than most. RIP Smokey. RIP other characters. I read the book before I saw this
movie, somehow, and I missed some of the book scenes, but overall this was fun.

**The Babysitter**

If I'd watched this alone I would've turned it off after a few minutes. It was
garbage. It's like the creators of Scary Movie read Ready Player One, and
thought, yea, we can do that. Terrible.

**The VVitch**

This movie rules. It's about jettisoning a sex-negative, shitty family for the
loving embrace of Satan and a coven of witches. The vibe is sullen AF, and very
stark. I think I've seen this movie five times, three of those in the theater.
This was a perfect movie to watch during Samhain.

**Thor: Ragnarok**

A+ super hero movie. Silly and unpretentious.

**Lady Bird**

The truest old millennial movie. I cried a lot.

**The Room**

Terrible movie. Great rewatch. This movie is epically bad, and I hope everyone
has had a chance to see the copious softcore sex scenes, and confusing "american
man" football rituals.

**Okja**

A sometimes cute, sometimes very grim movie about the evils of capitalism and
factory farming. The protagonist is the cutest, and is really giving her all in
every scene, and Paul Dano and Jake Gylenhall manage to not spoil the movie with
their characters. Steven Yuen is pretty great, and Tilda Swinton continues in
her consistent "I'm definitely not an alien in human skin" character from movies
of yore.

**The Disaster Artist**

Wow. This movie is a parade of actors and actresses who loved the Room in all
it's weirdness. This movie falls somewhere between a tribute, a satire, and a
dramatic reinterpretation documentary. I loved it. Saw this with another
long-time The Room fan, and we both were in tears laughing. I will see this
again. The podcast [How Did This Get
Made?](http://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-disaster-artist/) has a [great
episode](http://www.earwolf.com/episode/the-disaster-artist/) for this movie too
that begins with their The Room episode.

**It Follows**

This is my second viewing, and this movie was still unbelievably creepy. I made
my friend watch American Vandal with me after this to get less scared. It's a
horror film about an STI haunting. I dunno. It's wild. Watch this, but be ready
to always watch for a single, slowly-walking person in a crowd.

**Rare Exports**

A perfectly weird holiday movie about the real santa.

**Die Hard**

It's a wonderful holiday time for everyone, except german models turned
"terrorist". Points to this one for accurately pointing out that white people
are the bad guys though.

**Star Wars: The Last Jedi**

Here for this. Love the porgs, and love Luke punking Kylo. This was a great
combination of ridiculous and fun. I like that Rian brought more humor into the
world of the star war.

## 2016 {#2016}

**Nine Lives**

Nothing could redeem this absolute shitpile. We thought it would be funny to
watch a movie about Kevin Spacey as a cat, but it was _unbearably_ bad. Avoid.
