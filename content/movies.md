**Safe**

Haynes captures another side to the creepiness of suburban life and loneliness of illness like the campy cousin to Lynch.

**From Dusk Til Dawn**

Clooney should always have neck tattoos.

**Bergman Island**

I don’t think I’ve seen a single Bergman film, which means a lot of this was likely lost on me. An interesting story regardless. “In Sweden we are very serious about recycling”.

**Spook Sport**

The Rude Tales theme!

**Koyaanisqatsi**

First time I’ve seen this movie without being high, and it holds up.

**Rogue Agent**

He’s never really a spy, ladies. Julian Barrett is aging well


**Wendell & Wild**

Excited to hear the Blank Check on this movie. Stop motion is always so cool.
