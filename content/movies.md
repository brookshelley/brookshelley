### Tarot

A way worse Final Destination.

### The First Omen

It would be more fun if I enjoyed this kinda thing but I’ve watched so many of these and they never hit.

### Stress Positions

This felt like my limited experience of trans New York, and is also the best pandemic movie.

### Furiosa

Rude Tales ass names.

### Fall Guy

Stunts are cool.

### Pulse

Still hits.

### Chime

Honestly expected shōnen bat to appear.
Perfectly disturbing.

### Bones and All

Music wasn’t as good as Challengers but the movie was more fun.

### Triangle

Triangle of badness.

### Challengers

Not for me.

### Maboroshi no Hikari

Koreeda really knows how to make devastating films about family.

### I Saw the TV Glow

“I just like TV shows”

### Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare

Killing nazis is great.

### Abigail

Unofficial M4gan? 

### Evil Does Not Exist

Yow.

### Arcadian

Nic Cage being somewhat low-key is always wild.

### American Gangster

Ridley Scott has a few slam dunks and this is one of them.

### Fire Island

Great camp movie for a camping trip.

### Mars Express

Super cool!

### Argo

A hoot.

### Problemista

One day I will make a brilliant movie to malign my most hated piece of software.

### Zone of Interest

The sound. Horrifying.

### Humane

lol.this would also make a fun play.

### Monkey Man

Hell yes.

### The People’s Joker

Some brilliance and a lot of silliness.

### Rebel Moon

Tell don’t show.

### Immaculate

Yawn

### Civil War

Holy shit what a movie!

### Beekeeper

Absurd but also a totally fun savior fantasy.

### American Society of Magical Negroes

Kinda wild that this was also a romantic comedy.

### Late Night with the Devil

A wild blend of a lot of horror into a new classic.

### Barbie

Imagine being the only gay Barbie in a world that ignores you. Mid as hell.

### Roadhouse

Man, steroids in Hollywood having a moment.

### Love Lies Bleeding

Muscle babes.

### One Shot

A call of duty cutscene but better.

### The Accountant

It’s tax season.

### Color Out of Space

Very silly. Lovecraft films always suffer from needing to show the unimaginable.

### All of Us Strangers

Strangely I read the book this was loosely based on back in college in 2003 or 2004 (which I only realized this was based on a book after this year’s Blankies). I haven’t seen Saltburn, but licking cum off Andrew Scott’s chest then kissing him is way cooler than bathwater, IMO. Also this was devastating.

### The Burial

A hoot

### Terminator Genisys

Serviceable!

### Tenet

A 70mm rewatch in IMAX. Stunning.

### Drive-away Dolls

Fun stuff.

### Next Goal Wins

putting your fingers in your mouth and saying whistle whistle is solid

### Self Reliance

_could a depressed person do this?!_
A B-grade The Game

### The Animal Kingdom

I feel like only the French could make a sci-fi movie like this.

### Monolith

Spooky

### Iron Claw

Damn I wish they hadn’t cancelled Mindhunter

### Sleeping with Other People

Charming.

### Guilt Trip

Just bing it.

### American Fiction

Funny, and also it’s bizarre that Adam Brody is somehow not the rich nerd from the O.C. anymore. I’m a sucker for anything with Jeffrey Wright.

### The End We Start From

Loved the book, and the movie was solid.

### ISS

Never go to space.

### Role Play

No one is *that* uncomfortable talking about sex, surely.

### Anon

Meh.

### Wonka

More fun than I thought it would be.

### Night Swim

Sorry, pools aren’t scary.

### Ferrari

Somehow this is my favorite Adam Driver performance.

### Boston Strangler

Gilded Age’s the Russells solve a mystery.

### Schindler’s List

No words.

### The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill

So funny and touching. Saw this for the first time with the main guy and the filmmaker in attendance and wow.

### Maestro

Damn.

### The Artifice Girl

Cool conceptually and a good display that sci-fi doesn’t need a high budget to be interesting and fun.

### The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes

It’s all fun until they start singing.

### Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny

Entertaining and silly.

### Eileen

Whomst among us hasn’t fallen for a weirdo.
