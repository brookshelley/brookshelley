### Sanctuary

Qualley plays mean well.

### Extraction 2

The action and plot of Call of Duty Warzone.

### Before We Vanish

An interesting counterpoint to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, with a lot more silliness and a slower pace.

### Showing Up

The number of voicemails and phone calls in this was stressful. I wish she'd paid more attention to her cat.

### Invasion of the Body Snatchers

We need more protagonists that are food inspectors. A movie telling the truth about flowers (bad) for once.

### Fast X

Lol.

### Solaris

Clooney is great in space. I've never seen the original. This made me want to rewatch Interstellar.

### Swiss Army Man

I think this is what men talk about in therapy.

### Children of Men

Still hits.

### Fool’s Gold

A bit of Buster Keaton, excellent cameos, and a lot of heart.

### Blackberry

Outstanding. Riveting with some outstanding acting. I never had a Blackberry, so I was pretty unfamiliar with the story, but damn.

### Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse

Fun but way too long.

### Hypnotic

You can tell someone had a psychic influence concept and then kinda skipped world building and didn't nail the landing.

### Reality

The past 22 years are such a massive clusterfuck it's going to be wild to read about them in 30 more.

### Double Jeopardy

Inexplicably I remember my parents going to see this in the theater. Lots of this had me guffawing. A solid, if not erotic, thriller. Gish rules.

### Tour de Pharmacy

Lol what a weird hoot.

### Evil Dead Rise

Different vibe than the other Evil Deads but a fun horror film still.

### Sisu

The man just wants his gold and casually destroys a bunch of nazis. Great time. 

### Con Air

DVD pile at the grocery store led to a post-race hotel movie night.

### How to Blow Up a Pipeline

...unless

### Scream VI

The logic of these movies never really works, but they're still fun.

### Return to Seoul

A gorgeous film. Lots of therapy fuel in this one about identity, family, and acceptance.

### Beau is Afraid

And for good reason.

### Tetris

Way more entertaining than I expected. Honestly this was a thrilling hoot.

### Knives Out: Glass Onion

Rewatch.

### Ant Man: Quantumania

This was a bizarre jumble. I don't really understand what it was going for, but I guess it's fine?

### Project Wolf Hunting

Con Air on a boat?! Nah, it's a much sillier gore-fest.

### Three Thousand Years of Longing

A fun, fantastical love story.

### 65

This would've been better with the girl played by Annette.

### Women Talking

I've read some Toews so I have a passing familiarity with Mennonite worlds, but damn this was both gorgeous and sad. One of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time too.

### Knock at the Cabin

A really strange twist to the Looking story.

### London Has Fallen

This president can’t catch a break!

### Take Out

A good reminder of how far digital cinema has come. Watching this in 2023 felt much more voyueristic than I think was intended—like, now this could be shot on an iPhone with no issue. The silence of the protagonist made this almost feel like a restaurant RPG.

### Infinity Pool

The only movie that has ever captured the feeling of staying at a resort hotel.

### Olympus Has Fallen

I love that this was a competitor for another movie about a White House attack.

### Yellow Sea

The less glamorous side of contract killing.

### Fire of Love

Dang.

### The Nice Guys

Took a minute to tune-into the vibe of this film, but eventually it hit.

### Skinamarink

Not a movie barely a screensaver.

### Plane

_Yelling_ PLANE!

### Bone Collector

Tonights theme was collecting bone.

### Magic Mike XXL

A silly good time.

### Underwater

Rewatching an awesome underwater thriller.

### M3GAN

Hell yea.

### Magic Mike

This was my Titanic of the 2000s insofar as everyone talking about how good it was made me never want to see it. I got over myself and it was fun.

### Sully

Tom Hanks playing a guy who's great at planes, and the guy from GUTs making him climb an agrocrag of red tape.

### Deja Vu

Denzel laughing at physics.

### Roman J. Israel, Esq.

Colin Farrell was playing the Penguin in this, right?

### Fallen

Denzel should’ve played Constantine.

### Moonfall

Great.

### Penguin Highway

Cute

### Toy Story 4

I thought I'd seen this, but couldn't remember who "Forky" was. Repeated jokes on Blank Check made me watch and I'm glad I did—cute AF.

### Duplicity

_very Giamatti voice_ Show me the cream!

### Slumberparty Massacre

When I saw “Rita Mae Brown” I yelled.

### I Want You Back

Love a good classic romcom.

### Big Short

Still hits. Fuck banks.

### Weekend

My guy, take a typing class.

### Certain Women

Certain vibes.

### Aftersun

Dad movies. Fuck.

### The Post

The pre-chum box days when reporters still got paid well.

### Vampyr

I dug the framing in this—angles for days.

### Pearl

I liked X better, but this was occasionally fun.

### Four Women

Shorts on my Criterion list feel like cheating usually but I hate interpretive dance.

### Cold Lasagna I Hate Myself

Very funny.

### Safe

Haynes captures another side to the creepiness of suburban life and loneliness of illness like the campy cousin to Lynch.

### From Dusk Til Dawn

Clooney should always have neck tattoos.

### Bergman Island

I don't think I've seen a single Bergman film, which means a lot of this was likely lost on me. An interesting story regardless. "In Sweden we are very serious about recycling".

### Spook Sport

The Rude Tales theme!

### Koyaanisqatsi

First time I've seen this movie without being high, and it holds up.

### Rogue Agent

He's never really a spy, ladies. Julian Barrett is aging well

### Wendell & Wild

Excited to hear the Blank Check on this movie. Stop motion is always so cool.
