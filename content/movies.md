### Barbie

Imagine being the only gay Barbie in a world that ignores to. Mid as hell.

### Roadhouse

Man, steroids in Hollywood having a moment.

### Love Lies Bleeding

Muscle babes.

### One Shot

A call of duty cutscene but better.

### The Accountant

It’s tax season.

### Color Out of Space

Very silly. Lovecraft films always suffer from needing to show the unimaginable.

### All of Us Strangers

Strangely I read the book this was loosely based on back in college in 2003 or 2004 (which I only realized this was based on a book after this year’s Blankies). I haven’t seen Saltburn, but licking cum off Andrew Scott’s chest then kissing him is way cooler than bathwater, IMO. Also this was devastating.

### The Burial

A hoot

### Terminator Genisys

Serviceable!

### Tenet

A 70mm rewatch in IMAX. Stunning.

### Drive-away Dolls

Fun stuff.

### Next Goal Wins

putting your fingers in your mouth and saying whistle whistle is solid

### Self Reliance

_could a depressed person do this?!_
A B-grade The Game

### The Animal Kingdom

I feel like only the French could make a sci-fi movie like this.

### Monolith

Spooky

### Iron Claw

Damn I wish they hadn’t cancelled Mindhunter

### Sleeping with Other People

Charming.

### Guilt Trip

Just bing it.

### American Fiction

Funny, and also it’s bizarre that Adam Brody is somehow not the rich nerd from the O.C. anymore. I’m a sucker for anything with Jeffrey Wright.

### The End We Start From

Loved the book, and the movie was solid.

### ISS

Never go to space.

### Role Play

No one is *that* uncomfortable talking about sex, surely.

### Anon

Meh.

### Wonka

More fun than I thought it would be.

### Night Swim

Sorry, pools aren’t scary.

### Ferrari

Somehow this is my favorite Adam Driver performance.

### Boston Strangler

Gilded Age’s the Russells solve a mystery.

### Schindler’s List

No words.

### The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill

So funny and touching. Saw this for the first time with the main guy and the filmmaker in attendance and wow.

### Maestro

Damn.

### The Artifice Girl

Cool conceptually and a good display that sci-fi doesn’t need a high budget to be interesting and fun.

### The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes

It’s all fun until they start singing.

### Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny

Entertaining and silly.

### Eileen

Whomst among us hasn’t fallen for a weirdo.
