No one is *that* uncomfortable talking about sex, surely.

Meh.

### Wonka

More fun than I thought it would be.

Sorry, pools aren’t scary.

Somehow this is my favorite Adam Driver performance.

No words.

### The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill

So funny and touching. Saw this for the first time with the main guy and the filmmaker in attendance and wow.

### Maestro

Cool conceptually and a good display that sci-fi doesn’t need a high budget to be interesting and fun.

It’s all fun until they start singing.

Entertaining and silly.
