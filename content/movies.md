### Ghostwatch

Dated but still a fun haunting.

### Annihilation

A very weird adaptation, but I’ve seen it a dozen times and still love it.

### The Thing

I watch this and the sequel every year

### Take Shelter

Ok.

### Transformers One

A god-ordained king is why Britain always has free-flowing energon.

### Re-Animator

Wild that I saw Darkplace before this. Just the right amount of absurd wirh practical effect madness.

### Anonymous Club

Courtney Barnett sad.

### Nocebo

Much more interesting than the slate of catholic demon things out these days. Great music/foley, and a good weird vibe.

### The Package

Box a little bigger than the contents, but I enjoy a Tommy Lee as a bad guy flick.

### Alien: Romulus

As good at home as it was in the theater.

### Antlers

Potential but didn’t click

### Next Exit

Roadtrip!

### The Call

What if Your Name was evil.

### The Ides of March

The mids of march

### Den of Thieves

Much better when you skip all of Gerard Butler’s “troubled man” scenes.

### The Town

Hey I’m Boston here 

### The Bird with the Crystal Plumage

The music was giving me Daria vibes. Wacky but compelling.

### Ouija: Origin of Evil

Oh Marcus...

### Deadpool vs Wolverine 

I wonder if 10 year old Brook would’ve like this.

### Wolfs

Good mid-tier buddy comedy.

### Megalopolis

Just plain bad

### The Substance

A hoot! Reminds me of Italian horror gore stuff.
Fun with a theater full of people losing it—I saw one guy leave the theater and then saw him crying when I went to the bathroom.

### Afraid

m3gan it was not

### Slingshot

Hoping for Sunshine, but it didn’t quite get there

### Cuckoo

I imagine Dan Stevens plays Legion in everything now.

### Blink Twice

If only everyone who visited Epstein’s island could have such a grisly end.

### Vice

How does anyone (me) have the time to be mad about all the stuff that happened in the past 40 years of their life in their ding dang shit country? It’s cool though, the war criminal endorsed Harris I guess.

### Equalizer 3

I hope they make 10 more of these.

### Equalizer 2

5 stars for driving.

### Rebel Ridge

Amazing. Wondered where this came from and then realized it was from the Green Room director. Brilliant and painful. 

### Boarding Gate

Lower-end WKW-esque thriller.

### All the Old Knives

Rewatching Berlin Station and every episode of that was better than this.

### Extraction 2

Netflix action bonanza.

### さがす

This went to interesting places, and slowly built to an emotional crescendo.

### Chief of Staff

Surprisingly competent B-grade spy thriller

### Missing

wild and slow

### Chronicle

Still maybe the most fun super power movie next to Thelma.

### Thin Red Line

War sucks.

### The Killer

A few cool bits but deeply in the mid-quality Netflix realm.

### Prevenge

A fun film similar to My Wrongs 8245–8249 & 117

### The International

Halogen to the core

### Syriana

What a cast!

### Alien: Romulus

Right in my q zone.

### The Old Guard

Re-watching after listening to the Blank Check episode and it was much more fun this time.

### Twisters

I like the blank check theory that glen powell had sex with the mom, which led to no kissing at the end.

### Sneakers

Ben Kingsley’s little ponytail.

### The Instigators

It’s nice to see a fun action comedy.

### Borderlands

Wow this was horrible. Bobby Lee the only laugh.

### Psycho (remake)

Watched because Blank Check mentioned it on a Demme episode. Weird. 

### Maxxxine

Way more fun than I expected.

### Lucy

Absurd. 

### Trap

Thankfully this takes place in the Unbreakable universe.

### Joker

Maybe Todd should’ve just stopped.

### Kill

Chekhov’s hammer.

### Quiet Place: Day One

Good job cat.

### Waterworld

Wet Max.

### Bad Boys: Ride or Die

Lots of fun action.

### Synechdoche

Hits different at 39.

### Thelma

Wow. I loved every minute. All of the action tropes slowed and heightened. Straight up the middle good time.

### Longlegs

Hail Satan.

### Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes

I kinda don’t care about these CGI apes. Like, the CGI is good but it’d be cooler if they were cats.

### Beverly Hills Cop

Haven’t seen this since I was a kid and it still rules.

### Manchurian Candidate

Liev Schreiber inexplicably playing Buttigieg.

### Fly Me to the Moon

The kind of up the middle romantic comedy I’ve missed.

### The Watchers

Good vibes and a solid pace.

### In a Violent Nature

Conceptually interesting, but mostly unsatisfying.

### Kinds of Kindness

Hilarious.

### The Boy and the Heron

Gorgeous.

### Master Gardner

Hammer time.

### The Beast

Super slow from the jump. Back half was way more interesting but ultimately not my jam.

### The Strangers: Chapter 1

One of the more engaging thrillers I’ve seen in a minute.

### Hit Man

A hoot. More charming than I expected.

### Sex and the City 2

Just yelling “who wanted this?!”

### Sex and the City

All the outfits are deeply upsetting but the line “BOTH OF THEM?!” got me.

### Lumberjack Monster

SPD psycho.

### Downsizing

A little too self-serious at times but weird and good.

### La Chimera

Yow! Charming as hell!

### Tarot

A way worse Final Destination.

### The First Omen

It would be more fun if I enjoyed this kinda thing but I’ve watched so many of these and they never hit.

### Stress Positions

This felt like my limited experience of trans New York, and is also the best pandemic movie.

### Furiosa

Rude Tales ass names.

### Fall Guy

Stunts are cool.

### Pulse

Still hits.

### Chime

Honestly expected shōnen bat to appear.
Perfectly disturbing.

### Bones and All

Music wasn’t as good as Challengers but the movie was more fun.

### Triangle

Triangle of badness.

### Challengers

Not for me.

### Maboroshi no Hikari

Koreeda really knows how to make devastating films about family.

### I Saw the TV Glow

“I just like TV shows”

### Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare

Killing nazis is great.

### Abigail

Unofficial M4gan? 

### Evil Does Not Exist

Yow.

### Arcadian

Nic Cage being somewhat low-key is always wild.

### American Gangster

Ridley Scott has a few slam dunks and this is one of them.

### Fire Island

Great camp movie for a camping trip.

### Mars Express

Super cool!

### Argo

A hoot.

### Problemista

One day I will make a brilliant movie to malign my most hated piece of software.

### Zone of Interest

The sound. Horrifying.

### Humane

lol.this would also make a fun play.

### Monkey Man

Hell yes.

### The People’s Joker

Some brilliance and a lot of silliness.

### Rebel Moon

Tell don’t show.

### Immaculate

Yawn

### Civil War

Holy shit what a movie!

### Beekeeper

Absurd but also a totally fun savior fantasy.

### American Society of Magical Negroes

Kinda wild that this was also a romantic comedy.

### Late Night with the Devil

A wild blend of a lot of horror into a new classic.

### Barbie

Imagine being the only gay Barbie in a world that ignores you. Mid as hell.

### Roadhouse

Man, steroids in Hollywood having a moment.

### Love Lies Bleeding

Muscle babes.

### One Shot

A call of duty cutscene but better.

### The Accountant

It’s tax season.

### Color Out of Space

Very silly. Lovecraft films always suffer from needing to show the unimaginable.

### All of Us Strangers

Strangely I read the book this was loosely based on back in college in 2003 or 2004 (which I only realized this was based on a book after this year’s Blankies). I haven’t seen Saltburn, but licking cum off Andrew Scott’s chest then kissing him is way cooler than bathwater, IMO. Also this was devastating.

### The Burial

A hoot

### Terminator Genisys

Serviceable!

### Tenet

A 70mm rewatch in IMAX. Stunning.

### Drive-away Dolls

Fun stuff.

### Next Goal Wins

putting your fingers in your mouth and saying whistle whistle is solid

### Self Reliance

_could a depressed person do this?!_
A B-grade The Game

### The Animal Kingdom

I feel like only the French could make a sci-fi movie like this.

### Monolith

Spooky

### Iron Claw

Damn I wish they hadn’t cancelled Mindhunter

### Sleeping with Other People

Charming.

### Guilt Trip

Just bing it.

### American Fiction

Funny, and also it’s bizarre that Adam Brody is somehow not the rich nerd from the O.C. anymore. I’m a sucker for anything with Jeffrey Wright.

### The End We Start From

Loved the book, and the movie was solid.

### ISS

Never go to space.

### Role Play

No one is *that* uncomfortable talking about sex, surely.

### Anon

Meh.

### Wonka

More fun than I thought it would be.

### Night Swim

Sorry, pools aren’t scary.

### Ferrari

Somehow this is my favorite Adam Driver performance.

### Boston Strangler

Gilded Age’s the Russells solve a mystery.

### Schindler’s List

No words.

### The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill

So funny and touching. Saw this for the first time with the main guy and the filmmaker in attendance and wow.

### Maestro

Damn.

### The Artifice Girl

Cool conceptually and a good display that sci-fi doesn’t need a high budget to be interesting and fun.

### The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes

It’s all fun until they start singing.

### Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny

Entertaining and silly.

### Eileen

Whomst among us hasn’t fallen for a weirdo.
