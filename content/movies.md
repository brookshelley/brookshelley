### Companion

A lot more fun and well-executed than I expected. A bit of death becomes her.

### Presence

Dang that was great.

### Red Rooms

Tough watch! In retrospect I really enjoyed the determined protagonist, but initially I was on edge thinking Iâ€™d be subjected to something horrific. Thankfully the film captures responses instead of triggers.

### Den of Thieves 2: Pantera

Scumbag action film of the year.

### Get Away

I liked what it was trying for, but it was little too silly.

### Non-stop

Continuing the mid-tier Liam movies I've seen before series.

### The Commuter

Mid-tier Liam action I forgot I'd seen before.

### The End

My kind of musical.

### Cloud

Wanted to see this in theaters in Japan last year but the timing didn't work out. I love that everyone in this sucks. Also shout out to the suburban?!? What a weird car to have in Japan.
