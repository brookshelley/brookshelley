## 2022 {#2022}

**Apollo 11**

Wow.
This was a breathtaking documentary reconstruction of film and still photos. It’s amazing to see all the incredible space stuff against the backdrop of a time I’m only familiar with from old family photos. Short-sleeved dress shirts and chain smoking? Hell yea.

**Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes**

The camera work is outstanding. This one one of the more clever and fun time concepts I’ve seen on film. The acting is a bit ~~more~~ improv show than drama, but it comes together and continues to be fun.

**Moonfall**

"Mounting moon terror" is a phrase uttered in this film, and I couldn't be happier. A ridiculous moon disaster movie is exactly what I wanted tonight. The screw-up kid was a hat on a hat though, and ditto all the Elon shit.

**After the Wedding**

Another story of flawed men and regret, but with excellent performances, music cues, and a fantastic pace.

**Perfect Blue**

I’ve watched this a few times and it’s still a fascinating look at obsession and an entertainment career. I wish Kon was alive and making more movies.

**Death on the Nile**

The biggest shock of this film was that Brand could act! I saw this film’s predecessor in Osaka a few years ago and have a fondness for Branaugh and Christie. The costuming was nice, and the mystery taut. This movie makes me with I could travel again!

**Drive My Car**

This movie will stick with me for a while. I haven't read the story its based-on, so I went into it with only a one Hamaguchi and an idea of Murakami's style in mind. The use of silence and a spare soundtrack really lent itself to the long road shots and close-ups of faces. An amazing film.

**The Adam Project**

A thoroughly fun action film. This was well-paced, high-enough budget, and chill.

**What Keeps You Alive**

This is why I’ve always preferred a clean break and never trust a girl with a Jeep. A fun if a little long-winded thriller.

**Miami Connection**

A classic with first-timer Drew.

**After Yang**

Woah, a Lily Chou-chou song! This movie was a fascinating look at a struggling family. It was a less aggressively uneasy Black Mirror episode; thoughtful mediation on life.

**Fresh**

Initially I thought the guy in this was Henry Cavill, which would've been a little too on the nose. Also I will never believe that anyone sleeps in a bra despite at least two former dates doing so. Lesbian best friend is the new gay best friend? I guess this movie is saying that heterosexuality is basically the same as being kidnapped and slowly killed by a man... which, huh. Ok. 

**Spiderman: No Way Home**

More fun than I expected but I still hear “Spider-Man” in the voice of the grown man crying next to me in the theater during the Avengers movie.

**Hausu**

A weird and silly mess. 

**Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy**

Regret is a helluva thing. Fantastic.

**A Most Wanted Man**

RIP PSH. A solid thriller that never rises to the heights of other Le Carre but was a nice ride.

**Death of Me**

Top tip: don’t drink necromantic shots. This was spooky and utterly silly.

**Gaia**

This would pair nicely with Annihilation in a double-feature about our inability to make peace with the planet and cool mycology. Spooky and cool.

**Licorice Pizza**

“Fuck off, teenagers.” There's such a charm and delight to this film that in some ways mirrors the best parts of The Royal Tenenbaums. While Wes Anderson has fully lost himself in the twee, PT Anderson keeps making uniquely fun movies. I wish we'd gotten Melora Walters or Amy Adams as Streisand though. I have never listened to Him.

**Scream**

Can you make a referential movie so referential it transcends itself? Not this time. 

**Domino**

Not DePalma’s best. A mediocre political thriller with the music of a way weirder film.

**Fear Street: Part 3**

This was a satisfying conclusion and another fun queer horror slasher.

**Fear Street: Part 2**

A great take on the 70s slasher.

**Jackass: Forever**

This is basically the X-Men academy now and they’ve got their New Mutants. Truly hilarious. 

**Fear Street: Part 1**

A fun slasher that was much bloodier and wilder than I expected from something related to R.L. Stine. I think I'll watch the trilogy. 

**The Daytrippers**

A great 90s road trip movie about the failing relationships and weird families.

**Shimmer Lake**

I wasn’t sold on this initially but as it went on I was pretty pleased with the resolution. 

**Don't Breathe**

A little reminiscent of Green Room in bits. I didn't know who to root for in the beginning but the nightmarish sexual assault and forced pregnancy stuff made it clear who _not_ to root for.

**Crash**

A freaky, horny masterpiece. I’m worried everyone only has one set of underwear though.

**Outbreak**

It’s depressing how much more chill this was than the past two years.

**The Parallax View**

A neat, twisty thriller about a shadowy corporation involved in political assassination. Warren Beatty's hair is excellent, and the score keeps this feeling tense throughout.

**21 Bridges**

Somewhere between copaganda and a pretty exciting action film.

**Before Sunrise**

Elements of this were romantic and exciting but I can’t get over how much of a nightmare it would be for a man to talk to me on a train.

**Border**

This went to places I absolutely did not expect. It was very well shot, and rather fascinating. 

**Memories of a Murder**

I saw this a long time ago, and it holds up. A strange, twisty police procedural with a great 80s style.

**Izzy Gets the Fuck Across Town**

First thought: oh wow I have that bra. Second thought: this was a bit of a mess but also a nice little story about holding on to dead dreams. Sarah Goldberg should be in more stuff.

**Punch-Drunk Love**

This was far more charming when I saw it in theaters as a 17 year-old. While well-shot and strange, the completely bizarre actions of both Sandler and his sisters really made it hard to follow. Luis Guzman and Philip Seymour Hoffman were great as usual.

**The Most Dangerous Game**

"My life has been one glorious hunt." I've referenced this film for years but hadn't seen it. A bizarre and fun movie about hunting people. After the Chaplin, I was worried this wasn't a "talkie" but the sound was solid.

**Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence**

I've heard Ryuchi Sakamoto's soundtrack for this movie many times, but it didn't prepare me for the film itself. Takeshi Kitano! David Bowie! 

**Dune (1984)**

This movie is so nostalgic for me, as I grew up watching it regularly. It holds up well, but I vastly prefer Momoa’s Duncan to whoever played Duncan in this. Seeing another director’s take on the same source material I appreciate a show-not-tell approach to Lynch’s though there’s no way a huge atmospheric Dune adaptation could’ve been greenlit in 1984. To his credit though, Lynch somewhat managed to encapsulate a whole damn book in one movie. The weird Alia baby still owns bones. 

**Police Story**

Jackie Chan is a terrible boyfriend but an incredible physical actor. It's been a decade or more since I've seen a good HK martial arts film, and this delivered. Comedy, practical effects, and an ton of very wrecked cars and sets.

**The Kid**

Trash babies are Charlie work. This made want to have a little urchin, simply for the scene where he does his nails and then stretches in his absurd overalls. Also I’m pretty sure I’ve seen someone in Chaplin’s outfit in Harajuku. The OG short king.

**Worst Person in the World**

From the music to the pacing, I really dug this. The choices were incredibly true to life and brutal. Probably don’t date someone 14 years younger than you.

**Holiday**

A strange gangster film about abusive relationships and karaoke.

**In the Cut**

Meg Ryan wearing a beige slip is a bad look and I worry that Mark Ruffalo’s character has a lot of childhood sexual trauma. This was a strange send-up of the erotic thriller. "I'm starting to feel like a chick here."

**Air Doll**

Koreeda plus World's End Girlfriend?! This is a strange film, and a delight. I love a scene of a man forlornly washing out a rubber vagina tube. In a way, this is the weirdest Toy Story movie.

**Halloween Kills**

This reboot sequel is silly but fun enough to make for a good time.

**Monster’s Club**

Too cerebral for a Wednesday.

**The Eternals**

Fun enough. There was a lot of backstory and buildup but it never went anywhere too wild. The source material isn’t my favorite either.

**Dredd**

What if the Raid was way sparklier and shootier? This was a lot better than I expected, but was still pretty goofy.

**Event Horizon**

Where we’re going we don’t need eyes

**There Will Be Blood**

A comforting rewatch of a disturbing film.

**Benedetta**

Come for the pageantry, stay for the sapphism.
