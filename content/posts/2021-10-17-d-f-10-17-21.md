This week’s newsletter is brought to you by my childhood love of James Bond films, and my excitement for the new one this Sunday. The politics of the film series are relatively terrible, but considering the main character works for a clandestine organization, it feels accurate for him to be a real turd. I still can’t wait for him to drive fast and shoot stuff up real good though. I’m a simple woman.

I’ve played a lot of Metroid Dread lately, and boy, it [sure is hard](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22709647/metroid-dread-review-release-date-nintendo-switch-oled). If you like the series, or just MetroidVania games in general, you might dig this one.

If you’re looking for a grift opportunity, maybe you can convince a town to [pay you to do wizard stuff](https://i.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/126624095/council-to-stop-paying-the-wizard-16000-a-year-after-23-years-on-the-payroll) for the next decade or so? For a lot of us, pretending to be a wizard FR some tourists seems like a much more honorable job than selling more ads.

Either way, you’re going to need at least a little money for the very nice golf cart you’ll want after you read about [Japan’s many vehicles](https://medium.com/a-chair-in-a-room/small-vehicles-of-tokyo-7cdda49c2bf8). Friend of the letter, Joe, messaged me this week about an article he thinks I [posted before](https://www.treehugger.com/electric-cargo-bike-replace-family-car-5092791). I’m seeing more and more electric bikes parked at the grocery store, and it makes me happy. I’m hopeful the trend continues as folks realize they probably don’t need a 2-ton death machine to buy some ice cream. I’m keeping my car for special occasions and driving friends around, but I’m trying to avoid driving alone anywhere within 30 miles.

No matter how convinced people are about "self-driving" it seems like we’re [never actually getting there](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/10/14/dead-end-sf-street-plagued-with-confused-waymo-cars-trying-to-turn-around-every-5-minutes/). I’m very amused by the silliness of these robot cars, but mostly I’m just not convinced they’ll be any better at not hurting pedestrians than human drivers. What if we made self-driving little carts first?

An alternative to a world of endless power consumption is one where we think about offline access, and [alternative ways of connecting](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/saving-copies-of-everything-is-like). I am fascinated by 100 Rabbits’ seafaring tech adventures, and also attempts to play with the [idea of the browser](https://omar.website/tabfs/). I don’t know how much traction ideas like ["local first"](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) will ultimately have, but maybe we can spend more time on this and less trying to find ways of filling-up 32gb of ram. It’s enough to make me wish for the old days of IRC, before everything became heavy JS and media-filled clients.

## Closing

It’s a hot October so far--one that saw me wearing short-sleeves deep into the evening on Thursday while riding my bike around SF. I’m ready for winter, but other than the very early dusk, it’s nice to get a chance to soak in a bit more rays this year. In cycling, it’s starting to be a muddy CX season, and F1 is closing out a contentious series. It’s only a short hop, skip, and a jump until we all get much needed holiday times with our loved-ones. For now though, I’m going to curl up under a blanket with Snorri, and watch something fun on tv. Until next week, keep cozy, and keep reading, space cowgirls~
