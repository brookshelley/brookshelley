It got hot this month!

<!--more-->

## Books

### Rubicon

Pretty cool way of tackling eternal life, mixed with the dread of Edge of Tomorrow.

## Movies

### Sanctuary

Qualley plays mean well.

### Extraction 2

The action and plot of Call of Duty Warzone.

### Before We Vanish

An interesting counterpoint to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, with a lot more silliness and a slower pace.

### Showing Up

The number of voicemails and phone calls in this was stressful. I wish she'd paid more attention to her cat.

### Invasion of the Body Snatchers

We need more protagonists that are food inspectors. A movie telling the truth about flowers (bad) for once.

### Fast X

Lol.

### Solaris

Clooney is great in space. I've never seen the original. This made me want to rewatch Interstellar.

### Swiss Army Man

I think this is what men talk about in therapy.

### Children of Men

Still hits.

### Foolâ€™s Gold

A bit of Buster Keaton, excellent cameos, and a lot of heart.

### Blackberry

Outstanding. Riveting with some outstanding acting. I never had a Blackberry, so I was pretty unfamiliar with the story, but damn.

### Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse

Fun but way too long.
