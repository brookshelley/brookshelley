This is my birthday weekend and I’m absolutely beat. Not much to send this week, but I’ll make sure next week is extra special. Tonight I’m off to see a showing of Mullholland Drive, a movie I’ve only seen once before with my dad. I don’t think he enjoyed it, but I took him because he loved Lynch’s Dune, and that was a movie we watched together dozens of times. I’m stoked to watch it again with a friend this time.

## Closing

As a woman officially in my late thirties now, I can tell you that getting older is great but also after almost two years of pandemic-related isolation, I can’t quite party like I used to. Stay hydrated, and rest-up, space cowgirls~
