Happy Sunday from me, a very exhausted writer. We had a long weekend at work so I did my longest ride ever followed by a brutal ride to SF and up Twin Peaks with Drew to celebrate his new bike. Today? More riding, but just to get vegan ice cream. It's neat to see my slow (real slow) improvements on a bike, and I hope this investment in respiratory health makes my 40s and 50s better.

Was it cold where you are, or upsettingly hot? If it was hot, I hope you got to swim. A week later I'm still missing Sword Lake. I've heard you're either a lake person or an ocean one, but as a Texan, I grew up with a real horseshit beach covered in oil and jellyfish so I defaulted to lakes.

You can't see me struggling to write this, but I'm barely managing 20wpm because I thought it'd be _fun_ to learn [Colemak](https://www.colemak.academy). It's definitely been interesting to challenge my brain, but typing super slowly is frustrating, so I hope my fingers figure it out soon.

I love this [personal memory tool ](https://thesephist.com/posts/monocle/)and the general software philosophy of this developer. I've kept my notes in iA Writer for years with a nice log of all my tasks in Things, but the hot new thing is PKMs (personal knowledge managers) like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which is also where I'm writing today's newsletter. Have you played around with any new text tools? [Let me know](mailto:hello@brookshelley.com).

That last link let's you "electronically email" me, and the[ kids hate it](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/business/gen-z-email.html). I think declaring email _dead_ repeatedly is some kind of fetish for some writers, but if anything I think it's better than ever, with a few personal missives and neat newsletters (like this one) to look forward to, and one-click unsubscribe buttons now _de rigueur_. 

In diet and cooking myths, I have two morsels for you on [diet myth susceptibility ](https://elemental.medium.com/they-swore-by-the-diet-i-created-but-I-completely-made-it-up-c6d168e84c26) and the stubbornness of [cast iron tales](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-truth-about-cast-iron). Spoiler: you can use soap, just don't let your pans sit around wet for hours. 

## Links

- The [truth about the whole seed conspiracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/unsolicited-seeds-china-brushing/619417/) is a lot funnier than I expected; people love to ascribe to conspiracy that which is much better explained by incompetence and bad memory.
- [Dom. Lesbian. Strippers](https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/06/dom-lesbian-strippers-exotic-dancing.html). Cool.
- Trust me, [this](https://soundcloud.com/hoytie/33-simultaneous-orinoco-flows) is a bop. I learned about it from it's creator at a baby's birthday today. 

## Closing

Well my brain is tired of trying to remember where all the keys are on this weird keyboard layout, so now I'm going to pour myself a wine and watch the final TDF time trial (I'm writing this Saturday night, so don't worry that I'm day-drinking). I hope you have a delightful afternoon and as always, stay cool, space cowgirls~
