## Books

### Gnomon

Hard to follow at times, but fun and mysterious. I spent a while on the puzzle code but much like the one in Vandemeer, gave up after a while. 

## Movies

### Saturday Night

Went in with low expectations and they were slightly surpassed. Dafoe doing good work.

### Smile 2

More pop stars should be possessed.

### A Different Man

Didnâ€™t know what to expect and was delighted.
