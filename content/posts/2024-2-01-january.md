A first month with a record player meant I read a lot more books than usual. We’ll see if this is a thing this year or not.

## Books

### Super Cannes

JG you’re a freak for this one.

### Vessel

Cool story, if a little goofy at times.

### Static Ruin

Does it stick the landing? Yep.

### Void Black Shadow

This series continues to be cool.

### Murder on Sex Island

lol.

### Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep

The movie makes so much more sense now.

### A Murder of Quality

A fun little murder mystery.

## Movies

### Role Play

No one is *that* uncomfortable talking about sex, surely.

### Anon

Meh.

### Wonka

More fun than I thought it would be.

### Night Swim

Sorry, pools aren’t scary.

### Ferrari

Somehow this is my favorite Adam Driver performance.

### Boston Strangler

Gilded Age’s the Russells solve a mystery.

### Schindler’s List

No words.

### The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill

So funny and touching. Saw this for the first time with the main guy and the filmmaker in attendance and wow.

### Maestro

Damn.

### The Artifice Girl

Cool conceptually and a good display that sci-fi doesn’t need a high budget to be interesting and fun.

### The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes

It’s all fun until they start singing.

### Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny

Entertaining and silly.

### Eileen

Whomst among us hasn’t fallen for a weirdo.
