A few long books I didn't finish, and a lot of movies. Mostly this month I spent my night playing video games.

## Books

### Hell Bent

A fun sequel to Ninth House.

## Movies

### Tenet

A 70mm rewatch in IMAX. Stunning.

### Drive-away Dolls

Fun stuff.

### Next Goal Wins

putting your fingers in your mouth and saying whistle whistle is solid

### Self Reliance

_could a depressed person do this?!_
A B-grade The Game

### The Animal Kingdom

I feel like only the French could make a sci-fi movie like this.

### Monolith

Spooky

### Iron Claw

Damn I wish they hadn’t cancelled Mindhunter

### Sleeping with Other People

Charming.

### Guilt Trip

Just bing it.

### American Fiction

Funny, and also it’s bizarre that Adam Brody is somehow not the rich nerd from the O.C. anymore. I’m a sucker for anything with Jeffrey Wright.

### The End We Start From

Loved the book, and the movie was solid.

### ISS

Never go to space.
