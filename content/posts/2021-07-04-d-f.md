# D&F 7/4/21

Happy 4th, I guess? In Oakland fireworks are such a regular occurrence that I fear this day as it usually sounds like a war zone on the holiday. On the upside, I have tomorrow off, so I'm excited to bike off my sleepless explosionful night.

Are you grilling today? Cooking-up some wings? Near my apartment is a "cloud kitchen" which will soon join the world of the _[great wing shortage](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22456930/wings-feature-csk-entry)_. Even as I eat more and more vegan meals, I have a hard time resisting the siren song of _the wing_. This week I even made a pilgrimage to the chain [Bonchon](https://bonchon.com) to get wings and kimchi. It was delicious, though I almost kept face planting because their flooring was not kind to my very terrible-for-walking cycling shoes. 

Other than cycling, a long time hobby of mine is buying and reading tons of books. This week I read about how book pricing really hasn't kept up with inflation, making it very difficult for [small presses to survive](https://t.co/zLeoi0dcBc) the race to the bottom of pricing that Amazon enforces. As always, the best way to get books is either at a Library, from an author directly, or from a small bookstore where you can slowly build a relationship that leads to great personal recommendations. If you can't do any of those, I've also found [Bookshop](https://bookshop.org) to be an ok place to purchase things during a pandemic. Not to be all ["47 lambos"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GIwTG8V-Ko) but I had to buy another bookshelf during the last year to hold all the books I was stress-buying.

I mentioned him a lot last week due to his wild Alt tour, but Lachlan Morton is a [really interesting character](https://www.bicycling.com/news/a20041196/lachlan-morton-defies-the-world/). This wild solo tour of France isn't even the first time he's done a strangely epic bike ride. He's ridding across many a desert and through tiny [towns around the world](https://www.thereabouts.co/uluru). I don't think I'll ever have the endurance and grit this guy does, but every time I watch one of his videos, his enthusiasm is infectious, and I immediately want to hop on my bike and ride.

Finally, I generally treat TikTok as something to be kept at arms-length, occasionally enjoying something as it's sent to me, but not to be sucked-into. The [world of influencers is both sad, and bizarre](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/we-all-have-main-character-energy-now) but it really challenges the idea of celebrity. I can't particularly blame younger folks for trying to scrape together a living in this capitalist hellscape, but I think it's telling that selling your entire existence 24/7 and becoming a living meme is somehow preferable to the "work" available. I guarantee I'm not the one to coin this, but Warhol's 15 minutes now seems to be down to 15 seconds. Fame was a mistake.

- I learned about this movie last week during a live event from the Rude Tales folks. Just trust me, it's a delight:

## Closing

Apologies for being late with this week's edition of D&F. I went on a long bike ride yesterday that led me to a wine bar with friends (hi Haley, Dan, and Wonja), where I enjoyed a little _too much_ wine and came home in a fugue-state before passing-out watching a bike race. I hope you enjoy your holiday weekend with a little more moderation than myself, but also a fair amount of whatever liquids you enjoy. I'm watching the Austrian GP as I write this, and loading my belly full of oats so I can go on a long bike ride later today. 

Stay safe, and please don't start fires with fireworks this year, space cowgirls~
