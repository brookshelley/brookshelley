## Books

- **Our Wives Under the Sea**

	I gave a copy of this book to a friend, and I think she read most of it in the bath, texting me as it got stranger. I loved this book. I didn't know I needed a WInterson/Vandermeer combo story, but it worked.

- **Amatka**

	On a similar theme to my other favorite this year, Amatka tells a strange tale reminiscent of the best spooky sci-fi I've read.

## Movies

- **Triangle of Sadness**

	Seeing this right before a flight could've been a disaster, but fortunately my stomach is strong. I've seen this positively compared to the Menu, and I agree it's far more biting and hilarious. I don't think biting portrayals of the wealthy will change the world, but I still want more of them.

- **Barbarian**

	Fantastic, spooky, and surprising.

- **Decision to Leave**

	The build of tension and repeating themes of desire and memory were outstanding.

- **Nope**

	Much more sci-fi and speculative than I expected, and as funny was it was strange.

- **Men**

	Captured some of the strangeness of trying to return to the world as it decided COVID was over.

- **Speak No Evil**

	I told a lot of folks to go see this cultural misunderstanding horror film. 

## Music 

I've done this album ranking for a few years now and I still don't have much to say other than: music rules. If you want to read something smart about music, check out [my friend Mehan's work](https://pitchfork.com/staff/mehan-jayasuriya/).

- **Running with the Hurricane — Camp Cope**

	Folk rock vocals with a gorgeous voice? Sign me up.

- **Let's Eat Grandma: Two Ribbons**

	From the first track, this album rips. I listened to it a lot while riding up mountains, and it's even fun to sing along with.

- **Marina Herlop: Pripyat**

	This reminds me of Asa-Chang and Junray with a dash of Björk. 

- **‌Sharon Van Etten: We've Been Going About This All Wrong**

	Her previous record wasn't really to my taste, but this is my favorite since Tramp. A perfect album for a walk.

- **The Beths: Expert in a Dying Field**

	The Beths are keeping pop-punk alive and interesting.

- **Florist: Florist**

	Every Florist album owns bones. This one is haunting and beautiful.

- **Nilüfer Yanya: PAINLESS**

	One of the most unique and rad voices in music right now, with catchy tunes to boot.

- **DoomCannon: Renaissance**

	Great jazz jams.

- **Big Thief: ‌Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You**

	Every single album Big Thief brings out is somehow a step forward. Adrienne Lenker sounds like being in love.

- **Porridge Radio: ‌Waterslide, Diving Board, Ladder To the Sky**

	Queer English angst rock.

- **Lande Hekt: House without a View**

	An awesome upbeat counter to Porridge Radio. 

- **Alvvays: Blue Rev**

	When I lived in Portland I got to see Alvvays play live, and it was a blast. With five years between this and their sophomore record, I thought they'd broken-up. Fortunately, they just got better at making music.
