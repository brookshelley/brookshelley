# D&F 6/6/21

This weekend marked my first back at an outdoor bar with some friends; smoke-infused laughs and cheers were had. The bar required a vaccination card, which made the whole thing feel like a preview of a near-future. Honestly, knowing my co-bar drinkers were less-likely to carry COVID made me feel much more at-ease. I woke up Saturday with a slightly hoarse voice from the crowded bar yelling my body is no longer accustomed to, but also a big smile. Also, due to completely forgetting my wallet, I owe a few people drinks, which means a few more trips to the bar in the new future. I have a bit of hope that this summer will be a fun one.

Or perhaps... a [_hot one_](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8b75/how-to-date-during-horny-vax-summer-if-youre-looking-for-a-relationship). A friend last night reminded me of the time I spent sleeping around town, and honestly these days the thought of doing so just makes me tired, so this article about how to actually date was a soothing balm.

With the conclusion of the Giro Di Italia, and a resounding victory for the young Columbian Bernal, I'm watching a lot less bike racing lately. The next women's event is a week or so away, so this is likely just a temporary pause, but it gives me a good excuse to ride outside in Berkeley instead of inside with a race on tv. If you see my extremely weird tan lines, you'll know why.

Going outside more lately means taking more photos, whether it's with my [Ricoh](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-08-07-a-few-weeks-with-a/) or my iPhone, so it's nice to see an independent camera [software company keep making cool shit](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-08-07-a-few-weeks-with-a/). I've used Halide off and on for a few years, and loved playing with Spectre during a trip to Japan with my friend Sarah. The availability of mobile editing suites and tools is pretty awesome, and drastically improves the accessibility of the hobby. It's such a far cry from when I used to help my dad develop black and white photos in the darkroom in the 90s, but getting a good shot is still the hardest part.

When Chappie first came out, I remember everyone but William Gibson panning it, so I gave it a wide berth until this week. What changed? I read a few article about how it was [actually kind of neat](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/21/chappie-neill-blomkamp-robot-movie), and decided to jump in with a lower bar. Overall, it was [pretty good](https://letterboxd.com/brookshelley/film/chappie/), though Yolanda and Ninja don't really hold up. What even happened to them? Major points for Jackman's mullet though. Truly sick.

## Closing

Happy June, and happy Summer! I hope wherever you're reading this the vaccination rates around you are going up, and your friends and family are safe. Are you planning any fun travel this year now that things are calming in a number of areas around the world? Seeing family or friends or new babies? I keep thinking about travel, but the thought of flying is a bit foreign at this point, so I hope my old aviation fears don't rear their head again.

For now though, I'm enjoying the cool, shaded interior of my apartment, and thinking about what to read next while listening to the [excellent Japanese Breakfast record that just came out](https://michellezauner.bandcamp.com/releases). Stay safe, wear sunscreen, and enjoy the hell out of your week, space cowgirls~
