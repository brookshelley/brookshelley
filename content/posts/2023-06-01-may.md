## Books

### Wool

Fun to read while watching the show.

### Birnam Wood

A lot different than I expected but a fun thriller throughout.

## Movies

### Hypnotic

You can tell someone had a psychic influence concept and then kinda skipped world building and didn't nail the landing.

### Reality

The past 22 years are such a massive clusterfuck it's going to be wild to read about them in 30 more.

### Double Jeopardy

Inexplicably I remember my parents going to see this in the theater. Lots of this had me guffawing. A solid, if not erotic, thriller. Gish rules.

### Tour de Pharmacy

Lol what a weird hoot.

### Evil Dead Rise

Different vibe than the other Evil Deads but a fun horror film still.

### Sisu

The man just wants his gold and casually destroys a bunch of nazis. Great time.

### Con Air

DVD pile at the grocery store led to a post-race hotel movie night.

### How to Blow Up a Pipeline

...unless
