October

I didn't get nearly as much reading done this month as I usually do, and due to the size of Priory, and my current read, I only finished two books. That said, Laserwriter II was an all-time favorite, and Priory was one of the best fantasy novels I've read in quite some time. Quality > quantity. The same can't be said for the rogues gallery of cinema I dove into this month. 

## Books

**Laserwriter II**

A fantastic book about the 90s in Mac repair and the magic of TekServe and real sugar Cola. I loved how Laserwriter wove a simple new job story with the poetry of tech.

**Priory of the Orange Tree**

This could've been a few books, but it was well-paced despite its length. My only complaint is the final battle and wrap-up happened in a short bit of book. It managed to cram quite a bit of magic system and world-building into a nice lesbian fantasy story though. 

## Movies

**The Thing**

My umpteenth rewatch.

**Dracula**

Camp AF. Everything Gary Oldman wears is perfect.

**Addams Family**

A real hoot. Such a strange, fun movie. I haven't seen this since I was a kid.

**Alien^3**

I’d never seen the assembly cut, but dang, this is a grim movie. I wish Fincher had gotten to actually deliver on his vision, but sadly this is proably my least favorite Aliens film.

**Settlers**

A sad, but forgettable tale of a space colony.

**Saint Maud**

Just let a lesbian have a good time, damn.

**Dune**

YESSSSSSS THE SOUND, the beauty of every shot! It was so good it made me like tommy chalet better.

**They Live**

This so thoroughly influenced other media that watching it was a constant “oh yea!!”

**Titane**

If you’re gonna dragon a car there might be consequences. This was a nuts movie and I’m a little sad the car didn’t come back… what a deadbeat.

**The Card Counter**

Between this and First Reformed, I think that Schroeder is perhaps making the best films in the US that deal with our guilt and responsibility for the last two decades of war and devastation. A brutal and haunting score underlines a movie that will stay a with me for a while.

**No Time to Die**

A blast. A great second film to see in theaters.

**Spiral**

Not the strongest of the very goofy Saw series.

**Till Death**

Weirdly, the promotional images spoiled the suspense a bit. An ok thriller.

**Lucky Logan**

I’ve seen parts of this movie over people’s shoulders dozens of time during a flight, but the actual movie was very charming. 

**Creep**

A tight 70 minutes, but telegpaphed a little bit too much. I wonder what I woul’ve thought about this ten years ago.

**Night House**

An interesting look at grief and being haunted by our lost loved ones. I think I wanted this to be more hype House of Leaves, but it wash’s quite as wild. The music made me want to listen to Magnolia Electric Co.

**Big Trouble in Little China**

Kurt Russell is a great sidekick. Watching this again I realized how much of Tim Robinson’s delivery is based on this character.

**Free Guy**

A better Ready Player One meets Wreck It Ralph. 

**The Aviator**

Way of the future.

**Munich**

Chilling and excellent. It’s interesting to see james bond meet one of his foes for the first time.

**Zero Dark Thirty**

A very tense film that makes sure to only humanize selectively. It’s wild seeing an event that I read about in the news like this with Chris Pratt. Well-acted, and shot, but fuck. 

**Adrift in Tokyo**

A wholesome and cute rewatch. Joe Odagiri with a wild hair game.

**The Silence of the Lambs**

I haven’t seen this in years, and it sure is haunting. Five years or so ago I knew a few women who got spear of Longinus tattoos like Bill, which I still find wild. Goodbye Horses is a dope song.

**Eyes Wide Shut**

Still a fun and weird film but in the years since I first watched this, most of the bits now seem a bit tame. Who has an orgy without any kink?!
