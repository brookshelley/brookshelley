## books

### The Employees - Olga Ravi

This is cheating a little, but the paperback came out in 2023, so I’m counting it. Surreal and strange. The objects are good.

### Dead Silence - SA Barnes

Really cool space horror that nicely dovetailed with playing Dead Space. Spooky and hard to put down.

### How High We Go in the Dark - Sequoia Nagamatsu

I loved this meditation on loss and love. It captured a lot of the complex feelings I’ve had over the years about family and belonging.

### Just Like Home - Sarah Bailey

Dovetailed nicely with my re-watching of Stoker. This grabbed onto my eyes and wouldn’t let go.

### Wrong Way - Joanne McNeil

A clever and fun read about the future of tech and transport.
