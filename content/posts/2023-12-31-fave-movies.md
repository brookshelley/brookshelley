## movies

My entire movie list for 2023 is [here on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/brookshelley/list/2023/).

### Poor Things

A sex romp of self discovery with some of the most interesting locations and costuming in years.

### Monster

Fucked me up real good on the plane. Every layer a new arrow in my heart.

### Oppenheimer

More of a nerdy political movie than a physics one but I’m a sucker for pop political and proceedings stuff. Nolan, ya dunnit again. Asking if this was a smart movie is missing the point, because this felt to me just as crowd-pleasingly constructed as Mission Impossible or Tenet. This is the Nolan’s Sully as to Tenet’s Bond?

### The Killer

Amazing. Hilarious at times and wonderful crafted jaunt.

### The Holdovers

The trailer made me completely uninterested in seeing this, but the movie was great. Giamati playing the Rushmore’ Cox cum Dead Poets’ Williams he was meant to.
