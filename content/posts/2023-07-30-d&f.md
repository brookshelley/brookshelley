It's blue skies and an end to July tomorrow. Nobody thought they could do it, but an atomic barbie double-feature continues to sell out through the country to the extent that I'll _never_ know the twist at the end of Oppenheimer. I did rewatch Tenet this week, so I assume Oppen-gangam-style is a temporal pincer move.

If you detect a certain fractured note this week, it's down to my continuing struggle to sleep early enough to wake up for work and cycling. In my reading last night about circadian rhythm I learned more about the [genetic differences](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/02/25/early-riser-or-night-owl-new-study-may-help-to-explain-the-difference/) between the cursed day walkers and myself. Also, I guess I'm [a wolf](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/early-bird-night-owl-4-types-of-sleepers-dr-michael-breus/)? I don't know what I should do with that information but probably having my last drink at 1am and reading until 3am isn't it.

Fortunately all my night hours leave me plenty of time to collect...

- The loud fart sound of this 4-cylinder blazing down the track takes me back to high school racing and autocross. Honestly, despite how little I want to hear this car drive by my window, it would be a blast to chuck around corners. I'm not saying Haley should put an RSX engine in her CRX, but I'm also not _not_ saying that.

- Friend of the newsletter Jenny has a new book out in hardcover, and this [essay](https://www.theage.com.au/culture/books/dear-future-here-s-the-one-lesson-i-want-to-pass-on-to-you-20230515-p5d8f9.html) is a nice taste of it.

- Bikepacking? Bike touring? However you do it, it's fun to go out on your bike and sleep somewhere else.

## Closing

The rains in Belgium stopped long enough for the F1 boys to lap Spa, and as I write this I'm on lap 30/44 with one of my least favorite drivers ever leading the race. Broadly speaking, I love the Dutch, but this one little bugger... he stinks. I managed to wake up at 11 today at least, which means after hitting send on this missive, I'll shower and do a longer bike ride before another week of Japanese class this evening. The next few weeks will be a little busy and fractured from various events, but I'll be sure to give you your dose of links, videos, and whatever thoughts pop into my head and out of my fingers. Until next time, enjoy the first bits of August, and don't erect any shoddy signage on a downtown building, space cowgirls~
