A day late because I forgot what day it was mid-bike ride and sleep-catch-up. Sunday was spent with F1 racing, and some Japanese food with friends, after a 6 hour Saturday ride. I took this next week off from work to mentally prepare for a very busy June at work, so I plan to spend that time playing Zelda, cycling, and laying around.

- This [shit just keeps getting worse](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/may-anti-trans-legislative-risk-map). The rise of legislative and judicial attacks on trans people is a constant painful weight on all trans people in the United States, and it's horrifying to think of how quickly it blossomed. The reactionary, callow, greed-based political moves by the ghouls of the GOP are ideally the final moves of a collapsing right wing.

- Watching GCN always makes me want to ride for a super long-distance, or up a wild mountain. I don't have the time or fitness to do 250km+ in one ride yet, but some day this looks like a hoot.

## Closing


For those in the US, happy long weekend. A Monday holiday is such a BBQ and chill day, and I love it. There's a bittersweet feeling of work the following day, but none of the manic Friday off energy. Until next time, on the other side of my staycation, keep relaxing and simplifying, space cowgirls~
