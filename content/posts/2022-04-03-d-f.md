This week I'm even more beat than last, with almost 4,000ft of climbing over 4 hours and around 40mi covered. I rode with my friend Carlos and his team, and even though most of the time I was solidly spit out of the back of the pack, it was pretty sweet to ride with those guys.

Cycling continues to be my favorite hobby, but if you've tried to start up a new one during the pandemic, you might find out that it's [a bit of a challenge](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/what-a-hobby-feels-like). For me, I've ridden since I was a kid, so it's... like riding a bike. The freedom, and the joy of cresting a hill, and then riding down the other side, and waving at every cool animal I see is pretty unbeatable.

It's really easy to turn everything, from hobbies, to movies, to spending time with friends into a [measured "productive" thing](https://moretothat.com/the-time-trap-of-productivity/), which is a a bummer. I've definitely done this too in the past, and my tendency to put things on a to-do list is related to the dopamine rush I get when I check things off.

This week I also spent a lot of time thinking about [silences](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/impossible-silences), and the ways that we fill them all up even in a pandemic. I live alone, but so much of the day I'm in meetings, or listening to music or podcasts. I think making time for silence and cultivating boredom might be the ticket to figuring some shit out. I'll report back.

Have you heard of the exciting new trend of taking less drugs more often? It's called [microdosing](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22968997/microdosing-wellness-psilocybin-marijuana), and the kids love it. A friend of a friend did a lot of actual research and it suggests that microdosing might cause heart issues if done regularly enough due to how it [metabolizes and binds](https://chacruna.net/why-chronic-microdosing-might-break-your-heart/). Perhaps even with microdoses, less is more.

Finally, this is an old one, but a friend just told me about itâ€”have you heard about [the German tourist who ended-up in Bangor](https://www.sfgate.com/local/editorspicks/article/lost-tourist-who-thought-Bangor-was-San-Francisco-15940512.php#) instead of San Francisco?

## Closing

Tonight (Saturday) I'm going to bed early. I'm not particularly excited about Monday, but my body is telling me just how important getting to sleep and recover will be after that bike ride. I hope you get some good sleep tonight too, and head into the week with at least on happy moment from the brief freedom many of us share from the incessant grind of work. Stay chill, wear sunscreen (oops), and love someone as much as you can, space cowgirls~
