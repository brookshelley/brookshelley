## Books

### Negative Space

What a weird fucking novel.

### Titanium Noir

Good mix of hard-boiled and speculative fiction.

### Red Moon

This felt like a very realistic breakdown of how poorly colonization might go, and just how hostile Mars is to life.

## Movies

### Havoc

So much slow-motion. Action was good—reminiscent of the good John Woo films.

### Sinners

Damn that was good

### Warfare

Great “war is super stupid” stuff.

### Small Things Like These

Small towns are creepy.

### Opus

Weird and wild.
