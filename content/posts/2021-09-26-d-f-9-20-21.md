We had a brief chill taste of fall this week in Oakland, and it was incredible. I love the fall, and having grown up in Texas it was even more of a welcome relief if we got below 80F by Halloween. It's much more temperate here in the bay, but I still enjoy sweater weather.

With cooler weather I found myself getting personal records on a few climbs, which I celebrated with a few delicious beers. It surprised me to find out [this isn't a rarity](https://www.outsideonline.com/health/running/exercise-alcohol-research/). 

>  A 2014 study from University of Houston researcher Leigh Leasure, for example, linked both exercise and drinking behavior to higher levels of sensation-seeking...

If your last name is Leasure, can you become an athlete? I wonder if they own an electric car, like [so many Britons and Americans](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56748346)? Electric vehicles are one kind of future, and they certainly should be a replacement for the various gas-powered shipping hops for goods and sundries, but we'll need more walking and cycling to actually change things. Similar to single-family zoned housing, ownership of a car is a big sign of economic success for many, so it will be challenging to find new signifiers as a society. I'm not naïve enough to imagine that we can collectively decide to accept equality for the greater good.

Do you ever wonder what makes eBooks so terrible for some things, and why physical books keep selling? [Ian Bogost suggests](https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2021/09/why-are-ebooks-so-terrible/620068/) it depends on if you're into genre fiction or not.

> What any individual infers about their hopes and dreams for an e-reader derives from their understanding of reading in the first place. You can’t have books without _bookiness_.

It's not quite _booky_, but I enjoy [a great grid system](https://stasaki.com/710354/15/) online, and even employ one for [my site](https://www.brookshelley.com). I don't think hijacking scrolling for weird page movement is a great plan, but even I admit that site is pretty rad.

When the world wasn't mid-pandemic, I travelled and commuted a lot which meant carrying a Kindle chock-full of sci-fi and literature. Now that I spend most of my time at home, I've reverted to buying physical books again, and [the shelving to hold them](https://stringfurniture.com/cases/the-calendar). One thing I do miss is being able to browse a big bookstore like my [hometown favorite](https://www.bookpeople.com), which I spent hours in growing-up. But have you ever walked into a bookstore and felt [a sudden, disconcerting urge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariko_Aoki_phenomenon)? You're not alone.

## Closing

As I write this, I'm overdue to go feed "the boys," Stepjan and Lepa, that my friend R asked me to take care of. Neither of these cats has much interest in me currently, but I hope to win them over by the time Monday rolls around. Wish me luck. Also to all that celebrate, happy RenFaire to you and yours. I keep my LARPing on the bicycle, but I know how good a turkey leg and an ale can be. Until next week, keep your chin up, and pick out a nice sweater, space cowgirls~
