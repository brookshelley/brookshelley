Super late email this week! I woke up at noon Saturday because Elden Ring came out this week and I got sucked-in to the weird world of endless failure that Dark Souls promises.

Besides gaming I’ve exclusively been riding bikes or drinking for Haley’s birthday. 

Happy Birthday Haley!!

Today, I rode with Carlos and Brian around the bay for 60ish miles, soba, and schwarma. My legs are tired, and so am I.

Now it’s time for rehydrating and laying down for at least 24 hours.

## Links

- My only [link](https://ajpatana.com/nam-man-prai/) this week comes via the movie Death of Me, that teaches us the important lesson of “don’t drink strange Thai potions when you’re already drunk on an island”

## Closing

Happy end of February. Two months down and we’ve still got a pandemic, and now a Russian invasion of Ukraine to go with horrific anti-trans shit in Texas.

At this point I’m like, well 2023 is gonna be worse so I guess we’ve gotta appreciate these high highs, lol. 

But, then I spend time with friends or doing work with Basic Rights Oregon, and I get hopeful. More times in forests and less time on Twitter is endlessly rewarding.

Hug your loved ones, and have a nice beverage this week, space cowgirls~
