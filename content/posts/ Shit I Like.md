# Shit I Like

As the year ends and folks are buying gifts for each other, I figured I would post about the products I enjoy. I’ll try to keep this list updated in the  future as I test things and travel. If there’s a category of goods that isn’t listed here and for some reason you trust me to recommend things, email me and I’ll either let you know what I like, or add a new category of things I need to test.
