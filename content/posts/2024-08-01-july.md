## Books

### Until Thy Wrath Be Past

Fun to see how this got turned into a show.

### Witch King

Felt like it was gearing up for a series but found a good ending.

### Aurora

Maybe don’t go to space.

### Poster Girl

Fun.

### Aleph Extraction

Spies in space is still a hit.

## Movies

### Joker

Maybe Todd should’ve just stopped.

### Kill

Chekhov’s hammer.

### Quiet Place: Day One

Good job cat.

### Waterworld

Wet Max.

### Bad Boys: Ride or Die

Lots of fun action.

### Synechdoche

Hits different at 39.

### Thelma

Wow. I loved every minute. All of the action tropes slowed and heightened. Straight up the middle good time.

### Longlegs

Hail Satan.

### Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes

I kinda don’t care about these CGI apes. Like, the CGI is good but it’d be cooler if they were cats.

### Beverly Hills Cop

Haven’t seen this since I was a kid and it still rules.

### Manchurian Candidate

Liev Schreiber inexplicably playing Buttigieg.

### Fly Me to the Moon

The kind of up the middle romantic comedy I’ve missed.
