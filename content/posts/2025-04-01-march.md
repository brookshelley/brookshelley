## Books

### Ghost Station

Really loving these space horror books.

### A Haunting on the Hill

Spooky! A weird little update on the classic.

## Movies

### Heart Eyes

kinda fun

### Ash

vibes-based but not as much as I wanted.
practical stuff looks better than cgi in this at least.
some fun costuming and color work.

### Black Bag

Sexy funny spies get me every time.

### Last Breath

Harrelson: way of water. Fun in the "oh shit this is going poorly" adventure film way

### Rich Flu

A little messy with a LOT of obvious ADR.

### Mickey 17

Long-winded, but a fun sci-fi story. some of the beats fell flat, but enough of the world and Robert Pattison's acting won me over.

### The Shrouds

Month of Guy Pierce! Kind of a mess. the stilted acting might mean something, but it made this hard to watch.
I love Kruger and Cassel and Pearce but even they couldn't save this.
Can't help but compare the performances to Trap, which was at least a very, very fun mess.

### The Brutalist

A rise and a fall. The cursed emotional arc of Toth was tough to see, but the music and acting were great.
