My legs are beat! This is my first week of an outdoor training program to make me a bit faster up hills, and it was a tough one. Fortunately, tomorrow is a rest day, and I get to see a pal from out of town which will surely be a balm.

We're 4 short months away from 2022, and so far, it feels like it will be another repeat of 2020: lightly decreased case counts, followed by a rush to get super ill by a death cult intent on bringing the second coming of their god by destroying the world. Good luck with that.

It's hard not to become despondent about the state of the USA these days, but on the upside there are currently still trees, I've got a nice beer nearby, and my cat remains unstoppably perfect. As the Brits would say, swings and roundabouts.

If you're worried about our planet, perhaps you've felt some [travel guilt](https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change-is-ecoguilt-changing-the-way-we-travel/a-57528407). Choosing not to fly is probably not going to save the planet—we need regulations and large industrial change for that, but I know _lowering your footprint_ is a popular form of rich person minimalism not dissimilar from the [1mb club](https://1mb.club/) or making your [site a PDF](https://www.lab6.com/0). Which, hey, if it makes you happy! My [site](https://www.brookshelley.com) is only a few mb total with all the images, and 55kb on the homepage. Thanks plain text and basic CSS.

The Olympics are pretty terrible for so many reasons, but watching cool skater girls compete was objectively rad. Why did a [lot of folks think their runs were boring](https://slate.com/culture/2021/07/olympic-skateboarding-why-they-fall.html)?

This is the best thing I read this week:

> We often get asked about hands. You are welcome to hands but there is a limit of 5 pairs per customer along with other parts. Under no circumstances whatsoever will you be able to fill your car boot with hands. Please don’t ask.
	(_from a 'mannequin heist_ program in Lincolnshire, _just off the A1_)

H/t to the cool mom who told me to start reading Brain Pickings again, because I found [this excellent post](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/21/ursula-le-guin-dogs-cats-dancers-beauty/) about the late Ursula K. LeGuin's nonfiction. She was such a cool lady with a delightful set of books in her bibliography. Another writer I've loved for years, even though he's weirdly obsessed with women's ears, is [Haruki Murakami](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/magazine/the-fierce-imagination-of-haruki-murakami.html). In that linked profile the author goes running with Murakami and tries to figure out a bit more about where his work comes from. I've got a [book on my shelf](https://bookshop.org/books/who-we-re-reading-when-we-re-reading-murakami/9781593765897) that seems to be an [expansion of this essay](http://jaits.jpn.org/home/kaishi2014/14_005-karashima.pdf) if you're similarly fascinated by him.

Finally, support the protests against SFMoma ending their film program, and read a bit more about the [negative effects of capitalism on museums](https://backbeat.substack.com/p/ruling-class-solidarity-conflict).

## Closing

The sun is setting as I write this, and I need to go make dinner, so I will bid you adieu until next week. Stay safe, take care of each other, and we'll get through this, space cowgirls~
