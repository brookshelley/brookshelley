## Books

### Moonbound

Loved it.

### Sign Here

A fun mephistopholic slow boil. 

## Movies

### The Watchers

Good vibes and a solid pace.

### In a Violent Nature

Conceptually interesting, but mostly unsatisfying.

### Kinds of Kindness

Hilarious.

### The Boy and the Heron

Gorgeous.

### Master Gardner

Hammer time.

### The Beast

Super slow from the jump. Back half was way more interesting but ultimately not my jam.

### The Strangers: Chapter 1

One of the more engaging thrillers I’ve seen in a minute.

### Hit Man

A hoot. More charming than I expected.

### Sex and the City 2

Just yelling “who wanted this?!”

### Sex and the City

All the outfits are deeply upsetting but the line “BOTH OF THEM?!” got me.

### Lumberjack Monster

SPD psycho.

### Downsizing

A little too self-serious at times but weird and good.

### La Chimera

Yow! Charming as hell!
