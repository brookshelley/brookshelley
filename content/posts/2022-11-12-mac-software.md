With my move primarily back to the Mac from the iPad thanks to the speed and
battery life increases of M1 & M2 Macs, I've decided to revisit my [previous
post on setting up a Mac](/2021-06-05-first-downloads-for-a-mac/) to update it
with what I use lately.

Not a lot has changed, but I seem to be simplifying many of my previous choices.

## The apps

- **[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com)**

    A fantastic app and shortcut launcher with quick web and file search. This
    is the app I always wanted Alfred or Spotlight to be. It's easy to develop
    extensions for this app, and tons exist in the extension library.

-
**[1Pass](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-7-password-manager/
id1333542190?mt=12)**

    One password to rule them all, and in darkness, to bind them. This app saved
    me from years spent trying to remember various bizarre passwords, or
    repeatedly opening the Keychain app. If you know _anyone_ who uses a
    computer or a phone, this is the app they should install first.

- **[Things](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904280696?mt=12)**

    I wrote a lot about [how I do
    todos](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-05-02-on-notes-and-todos/),
    and I love this app for its speed and ease of use more than anything on my
    computer or phone. A delight every time.

- **[Arc](https://thebrowser.company)**

    I'm testing this new browser from The Browser Company, and have been for a
    while now, but I mostly use it when I would normally be forced to spin-up
    Chrome. I love having the same browser for all my devices, so until and
    unless Arc exists on iPad and iPhone there's no chance it's taking the place
    of Safari for me—especially with Chromium's poor memory and resource usage.

-
**[Fantastical](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/
id975937182?mt=12)**

    My personal calendar app is somewhat useless now that I can't load my work
    calendar onto my phone. I may revert back to iOS Calendar due to this.

- **[iA Writer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id775737590?mt=12)**

    An [indispensable app for writing and
    creating](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-09-04-hugo-and-i-a-writer/
    ), and where I'm writing this very post! I love how simple and elegant iA
    Writer is; providing minimal configuration to help me focus on the words
    themselves. It also helps that black and blue are two of my favorite
    colors—if only I could customize the cursor to be a theme-matching purple.

- **[Proton VPN](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/vpn/)**

    A VPN is pretty important if you enjoy watching bike races, or other media
    from around the world, and also if you ever use public wifi. I get this by
    paying for Proton mail and it does the little I need a VPN for.

-
**[Parcel](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parcel-delivery-tracking/id639968404?mt
=12)**

    With Deliveries dying a sad death by losing its ability to track UPS and
    Fedex packages, I moved to its competitor.

- **[Reeder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reeder-5/id1529448980?mt=12)**

    This is my [main news and entertainment
    app](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-02-10-slower-reading/), and I
    read everything from blogs, to newsletters, to Twitter on it. It's fast,
    cleanly designed, and integrates well with the RSS backend I use: Feedbin.
    If you want to support a different app, I recommend the excellent
    [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com), which is neat because it's FOSS.

- **[Slack](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slack-for-desktop/id803453959?mt=12)**

    This is literally my job, and the main way I talk to my friends.

- **[Discord](https://discord.com/download)**

    I'm part of a few small communities on Discord predominantly because of
    [newsletters](https://www.todayintabs.com) I
    [read](https://www.garbageday.email). These groups are pretty fun, and have
    mostly taken the place of "meeting interesting people" that Twitter once
    served.

- **[ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com)**

    Do you write on the internet and need to upload smaller, optimized images?
    This is for that.


## CLI Utilities

- **Brew**

- **Hyper**

- **OhMyZsh**

These apps are are a backing service for installing and managing packages, my
terminal of choice, and a good Zsh customization now that Zsh is the standard on
a Mac.

## Anything else?

I might download and use other apps sometimes, but this is my core few. If I'm
missing something you absolutely love, [write in and tell me about
it](mailto:hello@brookshelley.com).
