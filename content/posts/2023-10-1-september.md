Lots of riding and a big build-up to a century and a race.

## Books

### The Nakano Thrift Shop

If this was an English-language novel it would’ve spawned an HBO miniseries.

## Movies

### Stars at Noon

I've definitely known this character. This was a different film to what I initially imagined it would be, but still solid.

### Broker

I'm never emotionally ready for any of Koreeda's films. Everyone in this is looking for a family, even if they don't know it.

### No One Will Save You

Almost devoid of dialogue, it built tension with foley and music. The overhead camera and some of the chase work is outstanding. It was a little hard for me to connect with it in silence though.

### HUMP 2023

Another great collection of amateur and pro adult film. I love that this festival always vacillates between hot and hilarious.

### Bottoms

Excellent comedy about fucked-up young dykes. 

### Suzume

Was super tired so I saw the first ten minutes and the last ten because I feel asleep then rewound and watched the rest.

### The Elephant 6 Documentary

A fun and nostalgic look at a set of bands that meant a lot to me while going to shows in Austin.

### The Constant Gardener

He took breaks from gardening to solve a murder.

### Theater Camp

Damn. So fucking funny, and reminiscent of all my childhood musical and theater classes and productions. 

### Teenage Mutant Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

Great animation, and a fun plot that gets what makes TMNT fun. This is the best turtle action since "Turtle turtle, power."

### The Game

My generation's Christmas Carol.

### Alien Vs. Predator

Not nearly as cool as I thought it was when I first saw it, but also I'm a sucker for W.S Anderson.

### Se7en

Hadn’t seen this for 10 or more years and hrs still a bleak triumph.

### Hellraiser 2

Googled how many bands are called the lament configuration during the movie.

### The Meg 2

Some decent action set pieces, but it's hard to outdo the first giant shark movie. Long live Fun Island.
