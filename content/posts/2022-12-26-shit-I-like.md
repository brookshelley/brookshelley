# Shit I Like

As the year ends and folks are buying gifts for each other, I figured I would post about the products I enjoy. I’ll try to keep this list updated in the  future as I test things and travel. If there’s a category of goods that isn’t listed here and for some reason you trust me to recommend things, email me and I’ll either let you know what I like, or add a new category of things I need to test.

## Clothes

- Topo Designs Boulder pants
   These were a replacement for some Patagonia pants I burned during Thanksgiving. They're pretty great. I wish there were an option for full-length, but ankle pants are apparently the style.

- Enve, and Velocio wool trail shirts
   Travel + wool = happiness. I wear these during gravel cycling but also when I want to not worry about a shirt getting stinky after a couple days.

- Ornot socks
   Good cycling socks

- Albion, Velocio, and Ornot cycling clothes
   Broadly, these are the brands of cycling gear I have really enjoyed this year, after buying and wearing a lot of LeCol and Rapha last year.

- Houdini hoodie
   A great replacement for my somewhat worn-out Mission Workshop hoodie, and it's a bit warmer.

- Outlier beanie
   Thought I lost my fancy discontinued merino watchmen cap, but later found it. In the interim I ordered this and it's great.

- Adidas Samba
   Still my favorite shoe despite trying other styles over the years. It just fits.

- Organic Basics bras
   Good bras, good fit, and a minimum of fuss.

- Negative and CUUP underwear
   Comfortable and well-fitting, as well as pretty durable.

## Home goods

- Zojirushi rice cooker
   I bought the cheapest, smallest one of these from Berkeley bowl when I moved to California, and it's great. It cooks up to 3 cups of rice, and does it well.

- Induction stove
   A chill way to cook fast and consistently. My apartment has electric hobs that suck, so I threw two Duxtops onto the stovetop instead.

## Electronics

- iPad mini

- iPhone 14

- M2 MacBook Air

- Kindle Oasis

## Bags

- Bellroy studio
   My go-to travel and work bag. It has a nice texture, enough space, and is durable.

## Bike stuff

- Squid Gravtron
   My fancy new gravel bike. I've crashed it a few times, but it's still holding up. I've got a 1x SRAM Force groupset, and over-the-top Enve components on it to boot. Fast, and very cool looking.

- Canyon Endurace
   My go-to road bike. I bought a fancy Litespeed Titanium bike too, but the endurance geometry, along with the less-expensive nature of this bike means I rarely worry when I ride this bike up mountains.

- Orucase and Oveja Negra bags
   Great frame bags, bar bags, and bike-camping gear. 

## Coffee

- Fellow Ode grinder
- Fellow Stag kettle
- Hario V60 

## Toiletries

- Coway bidet toilet
   It heats, dries, sprays, and has a nightlight. Amazing.
