As the year ends and folks are buying gifts for each other, I figured I would post about the products I enjoy. I’ll try to keep this list updated in the  future as I test things and travel. If there’s a category of goods that isn’t listed here and for some reason you trust me to recommend things, email me and I’ll either let you know what I like, or add a new category of things I need to test.

## Clothes

- **[Topo Designs Boulder pants](https://topodesigns.com/products/womens-nylon-climbing-travel-pant?variant=41205325168693)**

   These were a replacement for some Patagonia pants I burned during Thanksgiving. They're pretty great. I wish there were an option for full-length, but ankle pants are apparently the style.

- **[Enve](https://www.enve.com/product/womens-merino-longsleeve-tee/), and [Velocio](https://velocio.cc/products/womens-merino-trail-tee?variant=40321411416137) wool trail shirts**
   
   Travel + wool = happiness. I wear these during gravel cycling but also when I want to not worry about a shirt getting stinky after a couple days.

- **[Ornot socks](https://www.ornotbike.com/collections/socks)**
   
   Good cycling socks

- **[Albion](https://www.albioncycling.com/collections/women/), Velocio, and Ornot cycling clothes**
   
   Broadly, these are the brands of cycling gear I have really enjoyed this year, after buying and wearing a lot of LeCol and Rapha last year.

- **[Houdini Mono Air hoodie](https://houdinisportswear.com/en-us/clothing/sweaters-hoodies/womens-mono-air-houdi-120714?color=120714A76)**
   
   A great replacement for my somewhat worn-out Mission Workshop hoodie, and it's a bit warmer.

- **[Outlier beanie](https://outlier.nyc/collections/objects/products/merino-watch-cap)**
   
   Thought I lost my fancy discontinued merino watchmen cap, but later found it. In the interim I ordered this and it's great.

- **[Adidas Samba](https://www.adidas.com/us/samba-og-shoes/HP7906.html)**
   
   Still my favorite shoe despite trying other styles over the years. It just fits.

- **[Organic Basics bras](https://us.organicbasics.com/collections/womens-bras/products/womens-tencel-soft-touch-lite-bralette-black)**
   
   Good bras, good fit, and a minimum of fuss.

- **Negative and CUUP underwear**
   
   Comfortable and well-fitting, as well as pretty durable.

## Home goods

- **[Zojirushi rice cooker](https://shop.zojirushi.com/collections/rice-cookers/products/nhs/)**
   
   I bought the cheapest, smallest one of these from Berkeley bowl when I moved to California, and it's great. It cooks up to 3 cups of rice, and does it well.

- **[Duxtop Induction stove](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-portable-induction-cooktop/)**
   
   A chill way to cook fast and consistently. My apartment has electric hobs that suck, so I threw two Duxtops onto the stovetop instead.

## Electronics

- **iPad mini**

- **iPhone 14**

- **M2 MacBook Air**

- **Kindle Oasis**

## Bags

- **Bellroy studio**
   
   My go-to travel and work bag. It has a nice texture, enough space, and is durable. This is discontiued now, so I would probably recommend the [Melbourne now](https://bellroy.com/products/melbourne-backpack?color=melbourne_black&material=fine_weave&size=15in).

## Bike stuff

- **[Squid Gravtron](https://www.squidbikes.com/products/gravtron)**

   My fancy new gravel bike. I've crashed it a few times, but it's still holding up. I've got a 1x SRAM Force groupset, and over-the-top Enve components on it to boot. Fast, and very cool looking.

- **[Canyon Endurace](https://www.canyon.com/en-us/road-bikes/endurance-bikes/endurace/)**
   
   My go-to road bike. I bought a fancy Litespeed Titanium bike too, but the endurance geometry, along with the less-expensive nature of this bike means I rarely worry when I ride this bike up mountains.

- **[Orucase](https://www.orucase.com) and [Oveja Negra](https://www.ovejanegrabikepacking.com) bags**

   Great frame bags, bar bags, and bike-camping gear. 

## Coffee

- **[Fellow Ode grinder](https://fellowproducts.com/products/ode-brew-grinder-gen-2?variant=40978992463972)**

   Simple, even grinding, with the only annoyance being the weird grounds cup lid and a tendency to static cling.

- **[Fellow Stag kettle](https://fellowproducts.com/products/stagg-ekg-electric-pour-over-kettle?variant=18635551080563)**

   Quick to boil water, and the temperature stays stable at your set number.

- **[Hario V60](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Drip-Coffee-Decanter-700ml/dp/B00755F9Z4)**

   A V60 matched with a Chemex, with all the benefits of both, and a better grip than the wooden Chemex one.

## Toiletries

- **[Outlier Grid Linen towel](https://outlier.nyc/collections/objects/products/grid-linen-towel)**

   Lightweight, nice, and quick to dry.

- **[Outlier Grid Linen bathrobe](https://outlier.nyc/collections/objects/products/grid-linen-bathrobe)**

   A fantastic robe for post-shower relaxation.

- **[Coway bidet toilet](https://cowaymega.com/pages/body)**
   
   It heats, dries, sprays, and has a nightlight. Amazing.
