It's a real wine weekend! Friday ended with a nice trip to Ordinaire with my friend Soleil and tonight there's an event at Brocc Cellars. I don't know much about wine, but I enjoy trying it out and hearing all the stories of its cultivation.

Plus, the word "terroir" sounds cool.

Even though the completely avoidable, human-caused global warming is making some strange places much better wine regions, [we should all get involved in stopping it](https://heated.world/p/what-can-i-do-anything). 

Are you hungry? Maybe have some...

It's strange but understandable when an author or artist wants to stay anonymous, and I love [this weirdo who exclusively mails his novels](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/on-the-trail-of-a-mysterious-pseudonymous-author) to folks he admires.

I've sung this [praises of RSS before](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-02-22-a-twitter-experiment-using-rss-to-readonly-twitter/), but there's never been a better time than now to use it in addition to or [instead of endless scrolling](https://ncase.me/rss/). I haven't really used Twitter for the last 7 months, and because of RSS and Discord, I don't feel like I've missed anything. [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com) helps too. I don't miss the constant callouts and [_main character_](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/we-all-have-main-character-energy-now) nightmares. Chatting with people on Discord and Slack means I can drop in my anodyne thoughts and jokes with no friction, and even have an actual conversation! Wild, I know.

An update on my _keyboard journey_ this week: I'm up to 37wpm at
97% accuracy using [Colemak](https://colemak.com) and feeling less despondent about my ability to learn new things or do my job (which is a lot of typing) in a reasonable amount of time. Is it better? Only a few more weeks of practice to find out. A friend suggested that perhaps swapping layouts when my qwerty speed was 115wpm seemed silly so hopefully there's at least a payoff in comfort. I'll probably blog about the whole thing at some point, so [subscribe](https://www.brookshelley.com/index.xml) if that sounds _thrilling_.

This week I watched a wild Chinese action/thriller called _Drug War_ and was left wondering why the hell there were so many [Buicks on the roads](https://carbuzz.com/news/these-are-the-reasons-why-buicks-in-china-are-much-better-than-in-the-us) there. The short answer is that they're fancier in China and have no real old fogey stigma.

## Closing

My legs are a bit beat this week after all my riding last week, but I plan to noodle around Berkeley and the hills anyway. Lately, I get so much mental space from the outdoor air, and am trying to maximize my use of the sunlight and smoke-free skies before the fall changes both. The delta variant has me a bit freaked-out too, but I think riding largely alone outside is relatively safe. I hope you're staying safe too and keeping your spirits high. As always, stay stoked space cowgirls~
