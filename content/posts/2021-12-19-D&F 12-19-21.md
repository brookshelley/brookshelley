Happy cancelled plans and increased anxiety weekend! With the Omicron variant _hotting-up_, I've cancelled my impending trip to New York, and while I'm frustrated, hopefully I'll be able to visit again in the spring. In the meantime, I've gotten a second Pfizer shot, bringing met to one J&J and a full set of Pfizer. A guy at the vaccine site was incredibly excited to see me reading a physical book (Slaughterhouse Five) and was insistent that I watch Dr. Strangelove this weekend.

Six months from now, I suppose I'll get a booster as well, perhaps of Moderna? I'm quickly turning into the guy from the TikTok video:

As I deal with the side-effects of a vaccine, I'm looking outside and wishing I could cycle—instead of doing so I'm watching [bike videos](https://www.albioncycling.com/2021/12/pan-celtic-race-2021-the-film/). There's also a rather charming Zwift Academy final happening on GCN:

I'll never be as fast as these folks, but the beauty of cycling is that I can still enjoy many of the same rides, and feel a comparable amount of pain and satisfaction as I push myself to my own limits. I don't know why that's fun for me, but it really is great.

Have you ever wondered if your cat is a psychopath? [This quiz](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-develop-a-questionnaire-to-identify-whether-your-cat-is-a-psychopath) purports to reveal their feline dark triad. Snorri is entirely too loving, loyal, and cuddly to be even mildly sociopathic. He's a needy, delightful boy. I still think he'd eat my body if I died though, because that's just how these things work.

If you've been online lately, you've likely heard of Web3, or NFTs, or _crypto_, and wondered, "am I missing out, or is this really as stupid as it seems?" Folks, it's [even worse](https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/web3-fraud).

And speaking of things that are obviously bad, but people keep getting sucked into, I present to you, [keeping up with the suburban Jonses](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22673605/upper-middle-class-meritocracy-matthew-stewart). It frustrates me that instead of thinking about how we can address climate and social ills together as a community, the majority of middle-class Americans are just chasing a false dream and hating it. Our richest are busy either flying partially into space on dong-rockets, or offshoring their money and their child sex rings, which is decidedly worse. There's more of us than them though, so I still hope we can overthrow the kleptocracy, and fight for a kinder, calmer planet.

## Closing

The new season of the Witcher dropped this weekend, so you know where I'll be—sitting in front of my TV with a mug of nog and a handful of popcorn. I'm glad the days will begin to get longer again soon, and I'm hopeful that despite my cancelled plans, I get to have a nice holiday of cycling and cooking with a few pals. Whether you're traveling, or holeing-up like me, I wish you an excellent week. Stay safe, get boosted, and drink a nogavit for me, space cowgirls~
