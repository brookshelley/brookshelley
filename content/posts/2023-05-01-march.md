# april

This month was mostly for TV:
Luther, Poker Face, and some rewatches too. Also of note: Paris Roubaix, and a couple F1 races.

## books

### Loki's Ring

After two of Lecht's books, I think her style is a little too on the nose for me, but I broadly enjoy it. When you're including an interesting set of genders and sexualities it's a delicate dance that in this case feels a little too box-check-y. 

## movies

### Beau is Afraid

And for good reason.

### Tetris

Way more entertaining than I expected. Honestly this was a thrilling hoot.

### Knives Out: Glass Onion

Rewatch.

### Ant Man: Quantumania 

This was a bizarre jumble. I don't really understand what it was going for, but I guess it's fine?

### Project Wolf Hunting

Con Air on a boat?! Nah, it's a much sillier gore-fest.

### Three Thousand Years of Longing

A fun, fantastical love story.

### 65

This would've been better with the girl played by Annette.
