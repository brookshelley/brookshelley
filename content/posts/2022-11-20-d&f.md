We're mere days away from my birthday, and I can feel the approach of my 38th year.

I wish this was the week that Twitter died, but as I write this it continues to shamble along, staffed by folks who can't lose their visa and the chuds who want senpai to notice them. [I loved Twitter once upon a time](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2022-11-18-online-and-social-in-2022/), but now it's just a shit hole that reinstated the saddest president that ever ruled the American empire. Elon truly is the rich kid who invited everyone from class to his pool party but the only kids who attended were paid to come. 

And speaking of sad things made by boring men: [crypto! What was it](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/) and why should you be glad you avoided talking to that one guy at a party who kept trying to tell you about bitcoin. Matt Levine is slowly losing his mind as the Elon and crypto drama continues, but sadly isn't radicalizing as a socialist yet. Perhaps one day he'll connect the dots and realize that capitalism was the problem the whole time.

The mining of this Ponzi scheme was terrible in many ways, but its effect on [global climate](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-to-think-clearly-about-climate-change.html) was up there with fleecing retirees and buying fancy cars for nerds in sin level. The article linked in this paragraph is all about how to cope with and understand climate change: not just how to grieve, but also what to _do_. I don't think it's a perfect post, but it helps clarify a lot of thoughts I've had in the past decade about the warming planet and our future. I think there's still a chance we can come together as a species and protect the most valuable resource we have, but it won't be something solved by a sudden technological innovation, or a SV grifterâ€”it will be collaboration and the death of exploitative capitalism that saves us.

As a person with a fondness for Japan, and a regular habit of visiting, I am very curious about how the country will cope with an aging population that feels more and more I[solated from prosperity and large urban areas](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/opinion/japan-society-economy.html). My next trip will take me across the country to Fukuoka, and I'm planning to do a bit of smaller town wandering when I can, because I'm fascinated by shutter towns and this phenomenon.

## Closing

Another week in the books and I'm pretty wiped. Fortunately, next week is very short, and then I get to celebrate my birthday and eat a fried turkey. Not too shabby! I'm off to watch more 1899, a spooky show about a 19th century boat gone wrong, and spend some quality time under a blanket with Snorri sleeping on and warming my feet. If you don't have a pet or a partner to keep you warm this winter I hope you find one or both. Until next week, take care, and stay warm, space cowgirls~
