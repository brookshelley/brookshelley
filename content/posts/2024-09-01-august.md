## Books

### 2312

KSR you’ve done it again.

### Available Dark

What if the detective was also a fuckup

### New York 2140

Just imagine the smell

### Until Thu Wrath Be Past

Asa always fun—reading while watching the adaptation.

## Movies

### Missing

wild and slow

### Chronicle

Still maybe the most fun super power movie next to Thelma.

### Thin Red Line

War sucks.

### The Killer

A few cool bits but deeply in the mid-quality Netflix realm.

### Prevenge

A fun film similar to My Wrongs 8245–8249 & 117

### The International

Halogen to the core

### Syriana

What a cast!

### Alien: Romulus

Right in my q zone.

### The Old Guard

Re-watching after listening to the Blank Check episode and it was much more fun this time.

### Twisters

I like the blank check theory that glen powell had sex with the mom, which led to no kissing at the end.

### Sneakers

Ben Kingsley’s little ponytail.

### The Instigators

It’s nice to see a fun action comedy.

### Borderlands

Wow this was horrible. Bobby Lee the only laugh.

### Psycho (remake)

Watched because Blank Check mentioned it on a Demme episode. Weird. 

### Maxxxine

Way more fun than I expected.

### Lucy

Absurd. 

### Trap

Thankfully this takes place in the Unbreakable universe.
