It was a long weekend with not one, but two parties. Saturday started with feeding a friend’s cat, then downing a baguette and heading to the Richmond bridge. I rode from my house, through Sausalito, to Bernal Heights, and it was delightful, if a bit flooded at times. The cooler weather mixed nicely with light hills, and flowed into catching up with old pals and then a housewarming.

Much beer and Kirschwasser flowed. My contribution was a small flask full of Aquavit. 

Speaking of fluids you may never have imbibed, I learned about [garum](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/garum.html) this week; a strange roman fish sauce. Rotten fish is an MSG bomb that never stops.

## Closing

This week was pretty short because I’m wiped from my bike riding, but I hope you had a nice weekend. it feels a little like things are coming back into a semblance of normality and I’m excited to see if it continues. Until we can live fearlessly again, stay safe, stay healthy, and keep dreaming, space cowgirls!
