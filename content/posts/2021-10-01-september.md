## Books

###The Word for World is Forest###

An interesting take on colonization, and how destructive humanity can be. 

###Unconquerable Sun###

I'm not too familiar with Alexander the Great but I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It was long, but never felt like a slog. Quite a few rad space battles and exploits.

###Everyone Knows Your Mother Is a Witch###

A meandering, funny book about being accused of witchcraft in the 1600s.

## Movies

###You Were Never Really Here###

This is like the most grim John Wick. Well shot, but damn, it was grim.

###Palm Springs###

Unbelievably charming. My accidental JK Simmons fest continues with a far more fun character of his, and a solid Connor O’Malley. The best thing I can say about this is that it made me want to fall in love.

###Whiplash###

If the goal was to make every character absolutely insufferable, then this was a great success. The way the film obsessed over the sweat and blood conjured by JK Simmons being one of the most abusive characters on screen was fascinating. Not a fun movie. Because I’m a “such jazz head” I did enjoy the musical interludes.

###Heat###

Absolutely rad except for Kilmer’s ponytail. The dna of this film is in so many heist films for the past 20 years. Al Pacino talking about butts blew my mind.

###Old###

If you drink every time someone says older or younger you will die.

###Prisoners of the Ghostland###

Checkov’s ball bomb. This was silly, but ultimately didn’t live up to Sono’s other work. If this was his first film we could say “oh, that guy makes ok schlock,” but I had pretty high hopes.

###It Comes at Night###

Not a great movie to watch during a pandemic, but definitely a tense one.

###Escape from New York###

Rewatched to listen to Blank Check. It’s hilarious to me that Kurt Russell is a libertarian.

###Annette###

Adam Driver is the worst joker yet. I don’t like musicals but this was so bizarre I enjoyed it.

###Wrath of Man###

Much more interesting than I first imagined. A wild ride of a revenge film.

###Kate###

A solid film. MEW should be in more action movies—imo she should take over Mission Impossible or something. Stylish and fast.

###Malignant###

Schlocky in a very 80s horror way. Not really scary at all, but just a bit silly and gory.

###Naked Singularity###

Fun and slightly surreal take on a heist and an underdog lawyer story. 

###The Colony###

An interesting post-apocolyptic tale with bits of Waterworld and NK Jemison’s Emergency Skin. I would’ve loved to know more about how the Earth stayed habitable, but that likely would be the long TV version of this story.

###Ex Machina###

Such an amazing film. The claustrophobic nature of the whole thing really enhances the haunting performances.

###We Need to Do Something###

I like what it was trying for but it didn’t capture my attention or really deliver.

###Antiporno###

I haven’t watched a Sono film in a while but man, it’s still a wild ride. I think Suicide Club is still the absolute best, but the absurdly surreal structure of this one was delightful.

###Sisters with Transistors###
Wow I knew very little about the history of women who pioneered electronic music. This was cool and full f amazing music.

###The Forever Purge###

Definitely the best of the purge films. A lot of action, and some solid, if not well-fleshed-out characters.
