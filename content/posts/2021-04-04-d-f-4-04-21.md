What if the entire last year was an April fool's joke? A few friends have told me they imagine waking up from a bad dream one morning in March 2020; realizing the pandemic was last night's cheese-inspired nightmare. On the upside, dream or not, the pandemic is showing signs of waning as more folks thankfully are vaccinated. I even went to a grocery store this week, albeit briefly, for the first time in over a year. Luckily, I remembered how to pay and offer a _smize_.

On the same walk, I had to duck into a builder's toilet in an _emergency fashion_, likely due to the fish & chips I'd consumed the day before. Training your body to enjoy beets and baked food means being destroyed by fried food I learned. Bodies: not a wonderland.

This week's brainworm? [Flickrblockr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3Qin7EJYbk). Before they got into trouble with a faked sex tape, Yacht were known for silly mini products like this and [a manilla envelope MacBook Air case](http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/culture/music/216809-yacht-future-claire-evans-jonah-bechtolt). Later, Claire [even wrote a book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_Band)!

And on the topic of worms, did you see [Wormhole](https://wormhole.app/)? Fast, encrypted file transfers up to 10gb feels to good to be true, but it works. I'm not sure what I need to transfer that gets close to 10gb, but at least now I know where to go when I do. Between this service, and those shady streaming websites, I wonder if today's youth even know how to _torrent_? Back in my day, you spent two days downloading a Spiderman, which you were sad to discover was deeply strange pornography instead. I think we're better off with HBO Max.

If you've been around a certain type of tech man in the past few years, you've sat through a long-winded explanation of "the blockchain" or "bitcoin" and how it might _change everything_. It turns-out the [only thing that it changes](https://thecorrespondent.com/655/blockchain-the-amazing-solution-for-almost-nothing/86649455475-f933fe63) is the boring topic you're sitting through. Blockchain: it's needlessly complex and somewhat worthless.

On this planet of limited resources and changing climate, saving energy is a much better plan. Let's use a [lightweight news site](http://68k.news/) instead of leaving our tvs tuned to a talking head or endlessly refreshing a media-heavy site. Even if you don't think we're in for an [imminent collapse](http://collapseos.org), which I'll agree is too much, we can all find and support lighter protocols and [less-intensive applications](https://github.com/mayfrost/guides/blob/master/ALTERNATIVES.md). I'll be honest: I'm not switching to [Alpine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_%28email_client%29). Much like [going vegan](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/vegan.html) I think the important thing is considering it and adopting as much of it as you can without becoming addicted to the purity of the thing.

## Closing

As I write this, I'm hopping on my bike to climb a virtual mountain with a group of women on Zwift for the [Tour of Watopia](https://zwiftinsider.com/tow-2021/), which is rad. I love riding outside, but not needing to worry about cars or flats means doing long, hard rides with relative ease. We can't ban cars, but if you drive one, please watch out for the bicycles and people around you. 

How's your April going? [Let me know~](mailto:hello@brookshelley.com) It's _open your windows and turn on the fans_ warm in Oakland lately, and I'm not excited about it. I love the chill falls and winters we have, with the light sweater weather, and cuddly down comforters. The spring and summer are all shorts and sunburns, but I'll try to at least enjoy wine outside this year. I can't wait till I can swim again! 

However you feel about the changing of the seasons, I hope your week is a delight. Talk again soon, space cowgirls~
