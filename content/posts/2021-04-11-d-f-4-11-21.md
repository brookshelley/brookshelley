What's the 411?! Do y'all remember when you could _[text Google](http://sms411.net/2006/07/google-via-sms.html)?_ back in the days when they were all about "don't be evil"? I do. Now, we all have phones with web browsers and apps, but back in the day, using SMS was a distinction of being a nerd. I fondly remember using a Symbian S60 phone to check my exchange email, even when I worked at the fruit company when the iPhone existed. Technology moved quickly after that.

If you're feeling nostalgic after that, you might enjoy this article about [video game packages](https://obscuritory.com/essay/incredible-boxes-of-hock-wah-yeo/). When you went to Babbages to pick up Rise of the Robots, were you wearing a Big Dogs shirt? Did you know they [briefly changed tack](https://www.gq.com/story/big-dogs-rebrand-efforts)? I enjoy remembering my electronics shopping there and at Fry's, but sometimes it's nice to [forget things](https://www.wired.com/story/weddings-social-media-apps-photos-memories-miscarriage-problem/). Speaking of nostalgia, this guy recreates famous intros with [stock photography](https://twitter.com/MattHighton/status/1356991693552316423?s=20).

Finally, RIP to a [real one](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8aea/rip-spacejamcom-1996-2021).

Or, do what I do and cycle around! Cycling is even better for the environment than the [cool flashy electric cars](https://theconversation.com/cycling-is-ten-times-more-important-than-electric-cars-for-reaching-net-zero-cities-157163) we're all eyeing these days. In a post-COVID world, I hope we can focus on public transit and electric and non-electric bicycles instead of expensive, heavy, and dangerous vehicles—the worst of which are the _huge_ trucks driving around standing-in for "[masculinity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/the-dangerous-rise-of-the-supersized-pickup-truck)".

The opposite of big trucks are [tiny dioramas in your bookshelves](http://toolsandtoys.net/minialley-bookshelf-insert-dioramas/) which I'm super excited about, likely due to spending copious amounts of time alone with my cat and my books. They're pretty sweet though, right?

This weekend marked the first time I've done an indoor event, albeit masked the whole time, with a friend. We had excellent Japanese whiskies and hung out listening to Jazz at [Bar Shiru](https://www.barshiru.com). I don't think I'll feel safe doing many of these for a while, but knowing everyone there was vaccinated definitely helped. A wild standout of the whiskey tasting was this [double-cellared Whiskey](https://www.kabukiwhisky.com/domestic-distillery/other-distillery/mars/k3-koma-dc2019/) which rounded-out our night. I can't wait to return.

## Closing

I hope you're staying safe, and can get vaccinated soon! I know that in California at least the requirements in many zip codes have dropped to 16+, and I hope the rest of the country and world follow suit shortly. It feels like we'll have a long tail to herd immunity, especially with the absolute shitheels who refuse to get one. I'm hopeful that we'll come of this with a lot of self-knowledge, and appreciation for the preciousness of life and loved-ones. 

It's been scary, sad, and challenging, but if you're reading this, I'm glad you made it. Take care of each other and yourselves and keep fighting. I'll see you next week, space cowgirls~
