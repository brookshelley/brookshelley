Summertime! I've only been swimming once so far this summer, but I have spent a fair amount of time sitting outside with a glass of wine in my hand. It's been nice.

We're certainly not back to "normal" with the delta variant igniting fears all over again, but at least most bars and restaurants around are requiring vaccines. My tentative plans to travel to New York and Europe this fall seem scuppered though, damn. Have you been able to travel? Did you have to cancel plans? I'm curious how folks are evaluating risk. Perhaps boosters and making anti-vax jerks into pariahs will help.

Have you heard of the wildly dangerous cargo that people love to crack open and eat? [It's called "pistachios"](https://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/ware/nuesse/pistazie/pistazie.htm/#selbsterhitzung), and the grandparents are nuts for them. I'm not sorry. Seriously though, I read those warnings with an increasing sense of fear. This simple nut is deadly as hell. I'm also reminded of the [deadly cashew](https://www.indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/why-cashews-arent-sold-in-the-shell.php). We might not all have nut allergies, but it is a wonder how we've survived long enough to know how to consume them safely.

If you've used software from a startup, or seen the website of a _hip_ company in the past decade, you're probably familiar with the ["Corporate Memphis" illustration style](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/the-internet-is-turning-on-big-techs-colorful-corporate-mascots/). It was fresh and interesting at the start, a nice break from the stock photo-heavy websites of the 00s. Today, it's much maligned, and it's [the fault of capitalism](https://www.protocol.com/workplace/why-is-tech-illustration-stuck-on-repeat-ask-the-overworked-underpaid-illustrators). I'm curious what will come next, but in general, corporate art is doomed to be blandly copied eventually.

Speaking of bland style, if you're sick of beige, empty homes you will be glad to know that [_maximalism_ is back in style](https://thewalrus.ca/more-is-more-the-end-of-minimalism/). I'm largely uninterested in the winds of fashion when it comes to my clothes or my home, but it's fascinating from the outside to see folks rush around to make their world look _just so_ for Instagram. We can all agree that either of these trends is better than overstuffed couches and farmhouse kitsch though, right? Buy a bright pink fainting couch and live a little. Just don't try to fit it in your [bourgeois tiny house](https://www.theonion.com/pros-and-cons-of-the-tiny-house-movement-1819594016).

If you're done with interior design, let's head outside and learn about [architecture and urban planning](https://matthew-carmona.com/2012/04/25/designing-the-japanese-city-part-one-an-individual-aesthetic/). If you get a chance to travel to Japan, I bet you'll be similarly confused and amazed by the variety of buildings.

I can't believe it took me 25 years to watch [Strange Days](https://www.curzonblog.com/all-posts/2016/12/29/the-films-that-made-us-strange-days-1995). It rules. Between the copious minidiscs and just general grubby delight, I loved getting to wander around Bigelow's view of the turn of the century. Also, there are some outstanding wigs.

- Want to learn about Black Timescapes and AfroFuturism? [Yea, me too.](https://www.blackquantumfuturism.com/post/black-timescapes-time-travel-temporal-displacement)
- I saw [this](https://gothic-little-caesars.tumblr.com/image/158244227463) on Garbage Day, and fell in love. The cheesy bread from Little Cesar's was both a delight and an actual nightmare for me growing up.

## Closing

After a long week and a few board meetings, I feel like I need a week off, so hopefully I'll get one soon. The staycation is the only way to do things now. Until next week, stay safe, and keep your chin up, space cowgirls~
