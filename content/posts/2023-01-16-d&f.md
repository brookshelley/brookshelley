You can call me Jeanne Tripplehorne because this week, baby, I'm living in Waterworld. At this rate, maybe I'll get to ride my bike again in February.

On the upside, it seems like we're already at over [100% of our snow pack](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/snowapp/sweq.action) for the year in the central and southern Sierras. I'm going to pretend for just a little while that this is the only outcome of human-caused climate change. 

Are you watching anything fun lately? I watched four episodes of Paul T Goldman yesterday, and wow, it's something else:

{{< youtube 7mMcugQTjHs >}}

This show is sort-of in the genre of Borat or The Rehearsal of mixing comedians with regular people for amazing results. The director of the show, [Jason Woliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Woliner) talked about the genesis and weird life of the show on [How Did This Get Made](https://www.earwolf.com/episode/last-looks-ghost-in-the-machine-morbius/), and it's worth a listen.

The beginning of the year can be a little bit of a media desert so I've also started re-watching the English Wallander and more It's Always Sunny. The classics still hit. It's also strangely fun to watch grown men attach turbos to things that shouldn't have turbos:

Youtube keeps me from starting a [Lemons racing team](https://24hoursoflemons.com) while also reminding me how much I miss making terrible car tuning mistakes with my friends.

## Closing

Happy long weekend to everyone who gets to celebrate MLK day! My favorite long weekend is the one where I forget I have Friday or Monday off until the day before. A Monday off is a great time to lazily enjoy coffee, [read a good book](https://bookshop.org/shop/brookshelley) or fall deep into an internet research hole about abandoned malls.

However you spend it, I hope you enjoy your time. Keep dry, and keep your cool, space cowgirls~
