# On Email

![hey](/photos/hey.jpeg)

With the announcement last year by Basecamp of [Hey](https://hey.com), which [the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch) called:

> “...a genuinely original take on messaging that feels like the first interesting thing to happen to email since clever apps like Mailbox and Sparrow...”

Intrigued, I signed-up for a trial account. I'd used Mailbox, Inbox, and every other fad email app or service in the past. Even by last year, I hadn’t felt the need to pay for an email address, and was jumping between clients [looking for the best thing](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-05-27-on-the-perfect-thing/). Between [Sparrow](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-11-28-2019-iphone-homescreen/), [Tempo](https://www.yourtempo.co), Airmail, Edison, Gmail, and recently Mail.app, I wasn’t ever satisfied. Partially, this was due to my desire to play with new toys—I switched around because I could. 

[Email is kinda neat](https://email-is-good.com), and maybe a lot of the the things folks don’t like about [email are good](https://www.justuseemail.com/dislikes-about-email-are-questionable/)? I think tools like Slack are better for a workplace, but as an individual getting receipts and other random things for services and from readers, [email](mailto:hello@brookshelley.com) works for me. It's an old standard, and an open one, and you can even [create websites](https://hey.com/world/) or use it for [newsletters](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-02-10-slower-reading/).

## Hey

With Hey, which honestly didn’t stick, I found a client that said, I found client that was opinionated but full-featured. I initially didn’t like Hey because it wasn’t clear how I could get the dopamine hit of clearing my inbox. Instead, I signed-up for a Fastmail account to host my website’s email, but found myself unhappy with the limitations of Mail.app, which I used out of a desire for more safety and security.

The privacy and information security risks of sharing my email credentials and sometimes _the contents_ of emails with various app makers and providers who benefit from my data by selling ads. I’ve tried Proton Mail and Fastmail, and they’re both good services, but the interfaces and apps are both limited and kinda dumpy looking.

After I'd ripped-off the seal on paying for email, I decided to go back to Hey—all $99 bucks of it. Luckily I got my name, and I didn’t need to email people with brookshelley6669@hey.com or something equally awkward. Initially there wasn’t much email in Hey for me, but I redirected a few things and suddenly I was getting a steady stream again.

Initially it was  overwhelming to need to “screen” each sender, but since folks message me on Slack or iMessage, I was able to ensure that marketing either ended up screened-out or in the “Feed”. Receipts and other errata could live in the “Paper Trail”. Nothing went to an “Archive” like I was accustomed to with Gmail and other systems. This was a worry at first, but I learned to live with read emails appearing in a list below anything I needed to deal with. Recently, Hey launched a feature that can cover that list with an image of your choosing, which is clumsy, but neat.

I don't think [Hey is for everyone](https://world.hey.com/jason/why-should-i-buy-yours-vs-theirs-4ceaacc5), but I can say it's working for me, and [paying for services instead of having your data sold to pay for them is a great plan](https://hey.com/no-data-extraction/). It's a relaxing feeling to not jump from app to app for a while, and instead know that the one or two times I open my email a day, I can quickly see what's important, and what's junk.
