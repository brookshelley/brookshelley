Apologies for missing a newsletter last week. I underestimate how overwhelming a huge bike event with tons, and tons of riding would be for my mind and body. I had a huge blast, but was completely spent by the time I pulled into my hotel in Redding on Sunday night.

The 5 is incredibly boring.

On the way up to Toledo, OR, I drove next to the coast and it was beautiful! On Thursday night I stayed in Arcata in charming place that looked like a campsite indoors, from the outdoor wall paint, to the  Coleman-esque kitchen stove. 

If you want to see what it looked like for a rider a lot faster than me:

I can't wait to do this again next year!

As I continue into the _third_ year of this newsletter, I'm even more glad I moved over to [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) instead of the [hellworld of Substack](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/05/substacks-founders-dive-headfirst-into-the-culture-wars). If you design and build a platform for public speech and you don't consider the ramifications of letting right wing nationalists, racists, anti-trans assholes, and mealy-mouthed misogynists run free then you're either supportive of them and or an idiot. I hope Substack and everyone who funded it loses their shirt.

On more delightful topics, Lael Wilcox wrote this summary of a wild FKT ride and starred in an [amazing documentary or her effort](https://theradavist.com/sink-into-the-earth-lael-wilcox-rides-arizona-trail/). Despite there being an asterisk oh her time, she is clearly the fastest woman to do this course, and I'm so glad her wife Rue is such a great documentarian so we get to share in the experience. 

When you're riding, it's very important to refuel with sugars and carbs, but even with 130 miles a week average, I can't imagine eating a [Swedish person-amount of candy](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/how-to-eat-candy-like-a-swedish-person). I'm equally terrible at eating tons of vegetables though, and am always in a fight with my stomach to digest much of any green thing. Even with my nightmarish digestive tract though, I'm stoked about [this roof-top farm](https://sf.eater.com/2022/5/18/23125365/deep-medicine-rooftop-farm-whole-foods-temescal-oakland).

## Closing

I've got a lot more to share next week, but for now, I have an F1 race to watch and a _lot_ of Japanese practice to finish before a three classes this week. However you spend your long weekend, I hope it's a relaxing and joyful time. Say hello to an animal outride this week, and imagine a better world, space cowgirls~
