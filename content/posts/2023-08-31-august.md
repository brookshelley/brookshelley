A big trip to Vancouver on my bike

<!--more-->

## Books

### Just Like Home

Dovetailed nicely with my re-watching of Stoker. This grabbed onto my eyes and wouldn't let go.

### Tatami Galaxy

Fun to read the inspiration for the series.

## Movies

### Bogeyman

Meh. I had some hopes but this was just so-so.

### All Jacked Up and Full of Worms

Music was solid, but I think it was too full of ideas without a real anchor.

### Stoker

Saw this in the theater and was surprised by it. Rewatching for Blank Check and, yea, still rips in a bizarre way.

### Thirst

Park Chan Wook with one of the best vampire movies.

### Zodiac

Love this.

### Oppenheimer

More of a nerdy political movie than a physics one but Iâ€™m a sucker for pop political and proceedings stuff. Nolan, ya dunnit again.

### Erin Brockovich

I love a good law procedural.

### No Hard Feelings

Adorable and surprisingly wholesome.

### Insidious

Forgot I'd watched this, which says a lot about it.

### The Martian

Another comfort rewatch. Just a chill time.

### World War Z

A comfort rewatch of a kinda silly but exciting zombie film.
