_An entirely subjective list of my favorite media_

## Music

I listened to a lot less music this year than most past ones between an increased meeting cadence and a tendency to listen to podcasts on my bike. Still, I heard many fantastic tunes. In no particular order:

**Lande Hekt: Going to Hell**
  
  So much of the mood of this album perfectly encapsulates how I'm feeling on rough days. A real delight of a downer.

**Sarah Mary Chadwick: Me and Ennui Are Friends, Baby**
  
  An album about bad dads? Yes, please.

**Floating Points & Pharaoh Sanders: Promises**
  
  A wildly good modern jazz jam. I had this on repeat for a while—it makes for a banging Saturday afternoon.

**Godspeed You! Black Emperor: G_d's Pee AT STATE'S END!**
  
  This isn't the best of GY!BE, but it's a great addition to their catalog, and made for nice dramatic times.

**Spelling: The Turning Wheel**
  
  It's hard to describe this album. It's wild indie-rock that reminds me of Björk and Nicole Dollanger, with a bit of Kate Bush. From the first track I found Spelling spellbinding.

**Clairo: Sling**
  
  Chill lesbian music.

**MAN ON MAN: MAN ON MAN**
  
  Their love is infectious, and the bops on this record are an antidote to a bad mood.

**Low: Hey What**
  
  The lo-fi electronic aspects of this Low album drew me in and created a good atmosphere. It's amazing that Low can continue to create such music this far into their career, but after seeing them live, I'm in awe of their performance and presence.

**Eydís Evensen: Bylur**

  This year I spent a lot of time trying to relax and work out stress while cycling, and that inevitably meant I needed a lot more sports massage. This album is pretty ideal for having a whiskey or getting a long deep-tissue massage.
  
**Laura Stevenson: Laura Stevenson**

A gorgeous indie rock album.
  
**Ada Lea: one hand on the steering wheel the other sewing a garden**
  
**Boy Scouts: Wayfinder**

These next two artists have a similar vibe with a very different sound. There's some great piano on _That's Life Honey_, but the real star of the show is Taylor's voice.

**Faye Webster: I Know I’m Funny haha**

There's a great 70s country crooner vibe to Faye Webster's music. I loved this follow-up to Atlanta Millionaire Club. Every song is a bit dreamy, and perfect for a bike ride or a lazy Sunday.

**Japanese Breakfast: Jubilee**

Every album Zanuner has released is outstanding. This is a bit more upbeat and fun than Psychopomp, but has some solid romantic tunes too.

## Movies

**The Power of the Dog**

**Dune**

**The Card Counter**

**Together Together**

**Kurt Vonnegut: Unstuck in Time**

## Shows

**Yellowjackets**

A late entry, and it's too early to know if it sticks the landing, but so far the mystery and haunting vide is perfect.

**How to with John Wilson: Season 2**

This show is a gift of incredible observations and social anxiety well-utilized. The first season was wild that I doubted a second could match it, but 2 episodes in, it's outstanding.

**Looking**

An older show that I didn't care much about watching until I saw White Lotus. It's cute to see many SF and Oakland locations I'm familiar with in a cute gay dramedy. I wish there was more lesbian content like this.

**White Lotus**

A holiday abroad triumph.

**Pen15: Season 2.5**

Ended on a high-note and remains one of the best shows of all time about being a teen.

**Quicksand**

Upsetting and riveting.

**The Bureau**

Possibly the best spy show on tv.

## Podcasts

This year I listened to a wild amount of podcasts, but Maintenance Phase was the most delightful, with the strangeness of Election Profit Makers, and the meandering fun of Blank Check coming into my top list.
