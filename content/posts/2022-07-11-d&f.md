# D&F 7/11/22

I did it!

I finally went bike camping.

Thanks to Emily, I got a waitlist spot on a women and NB bike camping trip to China Camp this weekend, and on Wednesday, I got a spot. If you've read this newsletter or my site for a while you know I love camping and cycling, so combining them is a long-time dream.

I'll write more about this trip on [my site](https://www.brookshelley.com) later, but for now I've gotta get back to the news.

> This is the test: If the platforms went bankrupt, or kicked you off, or you wanted to migrate, could you take everything you wanted with you? If not, why not build your creations on a path that you control and own?

It's important to [own your platform](https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-propriety-path-platform/). If you don't it can quickly turn against you, or into something you want nothing to do with.

A few weeks ago I watched Enemy of the State, a semi-prescient film about the nightmare of Homeland Security and privacy violations. A key prop looked really familiar, but it took me a minute to hunt down this [failed portable console](http://www.thegoldencloset.com/merchant/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=P00079&Category_Code=). I had a Neo Geo Pocket Color, a GameBoy, and a Sega Game Gear, but I never even heard about the NEC TurboExpress. Now it's 2022, and I'm playing black and white games on a [strange, rare handheld](https://play.date/).

With a new show dropping on the 15th, I am more excited than ever to share [Nathan Fielder's weird comedy](https://www.vulture.com/article/nathan-fielder-rehearsal-profile.html). During the first year of the pandemic I rewatched all of Nathan For You along with two seasons of How To with John Wilson. There's something indescribable about the joy I get from the awkward comedy of these two men. The effect of the constant questioning and long-silences is often excruciating, but the tension release of laughter is never far away.

## Closing

Sorry for being a day late, but I was bike-camping for most of the weekend and got home late Sunday and fell asleep. More next week on a regular schedule, space cowgirls~
