This will be a regularly updated list of software I use—every change isn't worth a new post. 

## The apps

- **[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)**
	
	With an increase in AI crap on apps like Raycast, I decided to move to something I pay for, that doesn't have a load of VC funding to justify. It's my favorite kind of software: well built, fast, and run by a few smart folks.

- **[Apple Passwords](https://brookshelley.com/posts/2024-06-19-apple-passwords/)**

	With the launch of iOS 18 and Mac OS 15 there's a new password app in town, and it's made by Apple themselves. It works with passcodes, can share credentials, and isn't built in Electron.

- **[Things](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904280696?mt=12)**

	I wrote a lot about [how I do
	todos](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-05-02-on-notes-and-todos/),
	and I love this app for its speed and ease of use more than anything on my
	computer or phone. A delight every time.

- **Calendar.app**
	
	Reverted to iOS Calendar since I can't use a single app for work and life.

- **[iA Writer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id775737590?mt=12)**

	An [indispensable app for writing and
	creating](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-09-04-hugo-and-i-a-writer/
	), and where I'm writing this very post! I love how simple and elegant iA
	Writer is; providing minimal configuration to help me focus on the words
	themselves. It also helps that black and blue are two of my favorite
	colors—if only I could customize the cursor to be a theme-matching purple.

- **[Parcel](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parcel-delivery-tracking/id639968404?mt=12)**

	With Deliveries dying a sad death by losing its ability to track UPS and
	Fedex packages, I moved to its competitor.

- **[Reeder Classic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reeder-5/id1529448980?mt=12)**

	I'm a little worried now that Reeder is the name of a new, very different app, and the one I know and love is called "classic", but it still works really well, so we'll see.
	
	This is my [main news and entertainment
	app](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2019-02-10-slower-reading/), and I
	read everything from blogs, to newsletters, to Twitter on it. It's fast,
	cleanly designed, and integrates well with the RSS backend I use: Feedbin.
	If you want to support a different app, I recommend the excellent
	[NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com), which is neat because it's FOSS.

- **[Slack](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slack-for-desktop/id803453959?mt=12)**

	This is literally my job, and the main way I talk to my friends.

- **[Discord](https://discord.com/download)**

	I'm part of a few small communities on Discord predominantly because of
	[newsletters](https://www.todayintabs.com) I
	[read](https://www.garbageday.email). These groups are pretty fun, and have
	mostly taken the place of "meeting interesting people" that Twitter once
	served.

- **[ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com)**

	Do you write on the internet and need to upload smaller, optimized images?
	This is for that.
	
- **[Lunasea](https://www.lunasea.app)**

	This helps with my collection of linux distros.
	
- **[Stacher](https://stacher.io)**

	A wrapper for youtube-dl; allowing for easy downloads of audio or video from a URL. The source doesn't have to be YouTube, but it often is—other times maybe something cycling-related.
	
- **[ItsyCal](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/)**

	I used this app a _long_ time ago, and even though it's probably out of date in some ways, it serves perfectly for my limited quick-calendar needs. I like how it has full keyboard navigation too. I wish it had semi-natural language event creation like Calendar.app now has, but alas.

## CLI Utilities

- **Brew**

- **Warp**

- **OhMyZsh**

These apps are are a backing service for installing and managing packages, my
terminal of choice, and a good Zsh customization now that Zsh is the standard on
a Mac.

## Anything else?

I might download and use other apps sometimes, but this is my core few. If I'm
missing something you absolutely love, [write in and tell me about
it](mailto:hello@brookshelley.com).
