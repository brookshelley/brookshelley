It's Scorpio season and the end(?) of Daylight Saving Time, as well as [Twitter as we knew it](https://www.techdirt.com/2022/11/02/hey-elon-let-me-help-you-speed-run-the-content-moderation-learning-curve/). There's a lot going on and some of it involves the livelihood of thousands of people. There's also a midterm election this week that has a lot of us very, very stressed-out. I don't mind if you don't vote, but it's only ok if you sink a mega yacht instead (I kid, I kid).

Speaking of kids, if you have them, or like seeing pictures of your nieces, nephews, and chosen family then maybe Shared Albums is the ticket to a better, more [private photo system](https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/11/in-praise-of-shared-albums-the-social-network-antidote/). Back in the day, this was Flickr for me—a big collection of friends and family photos I could peruse and comment on while sharing bursts of bike rides, jokes, and sincere outfit pictures. I work for _the Flickr_ guy now, but that product is sadly a graveyard now. I tend to share and view photos via Slack and Discord, but the more cute babies my friends have, the more I need a tool for this again. I mean, one of my friend's kids wears a COOL HELMET! Are you kidding me?!

I watched Good Time this week and a certain section of the movie had me look up if you can [overdose on LSD](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkeqd8/what-happens-lsd-overdose). The answer seems like, no, not really. You can get so high though that you end up doing something dangerous—I had a friend who died while climbing on hallucinogens. I still wouldn't go around mega-dosing LSD though, just to be safe. 

The politicians and people who hate reproductive rights love to pretend that abortions involve people with emotions and agency, when they actually involve [shitty little clumps of cells in almost all cases](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23435111/early-pregnancy-abortion-tiktok-social-media-images). I'm personally always going to believe that an adult has a right to healthcare and survival even if it means the ending of a pregnancy in _their_ body. The ghouls in the GOP would prefer moralizing over a an effective cyst, but never funding services, education, and housing for actual living people. Wild, right?

So yea, the moral of today's newsletter is: do some drugs, not too much, and get involved in changing the world for the better. Also, I guess, learn how to use Mastodon.

## Closing

Did you dress up for Halloween? Did you make sure to x-ray all your candy to make sure it wasn't [inexplicably genital-shaped](https://twitter.com/bestofnextdoor/status/1587234974096302080)? Well, whether you got your Reese's in bulk from an unsuspecting neighbor's honor bucket, or bought them on discount November 1st like a true patriot, I hope you enjoyed that peanut-buttery taste. I made it home from Oregon without COVID (so far, so good), and managed to give a lot of money away to help [protect queer rights](https://www.basicrights.org), which means everything went to plan. I even rode my bike in the rain a bunch while I was there. I brought the rain home with me to California as a fun souvenir for our plants and forest fire prevention efforts. Riding in the rain absolutely frightens me, so I hope we're back to dry conditions soon, but I do prefer this to smoke. Don't forget to sleep extra tonight, and enjoy your week, space cowgirls~
