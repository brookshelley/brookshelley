Happy holidays—whichever you celebrate. Personally, the coolest holiday (solstice) passed by this week and New Years is coming soon. My holiday plans to go to NYC were blown-up by COVID, and my general worry about getting sick means I'm trying to hole-up other than bike rides. I did get to see my friend Christine today, and her dope new house, even though the rain meant neighborhood lanterns were delayed a bit. I even got in three bike rides this week despite the extremely abnormal amount of rain in the bay. 

I hope whether you celebrated your holiday of choice with friends, family, or alone, that it was a great one. 

With season 2 of How to with John Wilson five episodes in, it's a great time to catch up and learn more about [his whole deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/magazine/how-to-john-wilson.html). I'm a huge fan of Nathan For You, whose creator is a producer on HTWJW, and I like how this show is a bit kinder and lets people just be their comfortable, weird selves. In a time where it's hard to wander around and have strange mini-interactions, HTWJW is a salve.

Name another law that's as consistently broken as [the speed limit](https://slate.com/business/2021/12/speed-limit-americas-most-broken-law-history.html)—there really isn't one. Despite data on the dangers of high speed, and the fucked-up amount of automotive deaths every year (not to mention the pollution, rare earth minerals, and eyesores of parking and highways), it's ludicrous we haven't found a way to curb driving or show things down. 

Community is hard to find and so easily lost. Especially during the pandemic, we're all trying to patch the holes in our psyche with whatever digital and chemical means we can find, but I miss the [real thing](https://longreads.com/2021/07/22/i-miss-it-all-devin-kelly/).

## Closing

After nearly two years of vague amounts of lockdown and isolation, it sure is getting old. I'm beyond hoping that 2022 is better, but I do at least hope we all have it a bit easier. Keep your chin up, and enjoy some much needed vacation, space cowgirls~
