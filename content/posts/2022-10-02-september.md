## TV & Games

### Cyberpunk: Edgerunners

So good it made me start playing the game again and wishing the game was that good.

### Inscryption

A blast! Short but sweet with exciting twists.

## Books

### The Sunny Nihilist

Pretty light reading but this matched up nicely with a lot that I’ve been thinking for years.

### The Answers

A weird send-up of heterosexual romance, male myopia, and capitalism.

### Nona the Ninth

I’m still not sure what I read

### Too Like Lightning

At times deeply frustrating, but it doled-out its pleasure at random intervals ensuring I kept reading.

### The World of Cycling According to G

Fun stories and info, if a bit disjointed. Definitely came off as a series of anecdotes instead of something like Gaimon’s work.

### Unnatural Magic

Not really my thing, but if you like awkward romance fic, this is probably up your alley.

## Movies

### Irma Vep

Avoided this for a while because I assumed it would be super boring, but instead it's a fascinating look at a film industry as an absolute mess of characters and mistakes. Cheung is great.

### Vesper

I'll have to rewatch this and let it sink in a bit. Cool world and somewhat Cronenburgian special effects. I want to see these directors do the second and third parts of the Area X trilogy.

### Baby Assassins

Solid fight choreography, a silly plot, and a lot of weird humor. Overall it was fun!

### Inside Lleweyn Davis

Imagine if folk music had been big in the 90s instead of boy bands, and Timberlake was just a singer-songwriter. Also I hope Goodman got an Oscar for his whole thing, but especially his hair.

### Hunger

Brutal. Incredible performances. Close all prisons.

### Loneliest Planet

Much much slower and less satisfying Force Majeure.

### Avatar

I forgot how long this movie was. It's still a strange 3D fern gully and I can't believe it's getting sequels, but I guess I'll see them so maybe it all makes sense.

### Watcher

Top tip: don’t gaslight your girlfriend. The dark side of Lost in Translation.

### Ghost World

This captures the teen angst and too cool vibes of the late 1990s pretty well. Buscemi is great and creepy.

### Lou

Pretty fun if straightforward. West Wing John Wick. The third act dragged a bit.

### Icarus

An incredible documentary on the decades-long doping program in Russia and the scientist who blew the whistle on it. With PEDs still casting a shadow over my favorite sport this was fascinating and sad.

### Freaks

A surprisingly interesting sci-fi jam.

### Anima

Thom Yorke doing a Mr. Bean meets Brazil.

### The Toll

A funny low-end gangster and cop film set in a tiny bit of Wales. I think I looked this up because of the main actress for Feast, and she was solid in The Toll too.

### Panic Room

Baby Kristen Stewart! Maybe one of the only movies with mother and daughter both played by lesbians? The first time I saw this was a very shitty SD copy on an old non-LCD monitor and I couldn't really see what was happening. This time was better.

### 誰がために

A sad story on how to grieve and not moving on.

### Role Models

Wild how a movie with at least one actor who sexually assaulted women has a different character who aged even more poorly. Bits of this were pretty funny but it’s pretty fucked these guys didn’t think “hey what if we worked with more women”?

### The American

We’re either too loud or we’re international assassins on the run…

### Captain Philips

Great time with Hanks but also even as a "based on a true story" this is hilariously bad economics... how many millions of dollars does it cost to float around in fancy boats doing night ops? 

### Goodnight, Mommy

Haunting and fascinating.

### Confess, Fletch

As a kid I really loved the Chevy Chase Fletch movies but don’t know if they would hold up, but this ruled. Hamm found a perfect role.

### The Invitation

I don’t even have misophonia and the nail bits were horrible. I was just complaining about the fanfic-ification of entertainment recently and this is a prime example of the goofy weird romance stuff that leads to. The twist is pretty obviously telegraphed and not much of a payoff, but I kept hoping it’d be a Cthulhu thing maybe? I hope  Emmanuel gets better roles next.

### Emily the Criminal

Didn't know what to expect but I had a great time.

### Breaking

Depressing! An empathetic tale of how poorly the US treats its citizens.

### Full Metal Jacket

Haunting and still amazing.

### The Spy Who Loved Me

Do you think the goons in red have a less obvious costume for when they’re not in the sea base? After rewatching Casino Royale I remembered that Bond can be awesome, but this is merely better than the other Moore films.

### Thor: Love & Thunder

G&R songs are better when they’re covered. This was fun enough with some neat fights but I wanted more god butchering.

### Fall

Lee Pace would’ve been good in this one too. I love a weird outdoor accidents film, especially when it has two rad women as the protagonists. I really hate heights.

### Videodrome

I forgot how most of the plot of this movie is Woods’ obsession with finding good porn. Long live the new flesh.

### Man with a Golden Gun

For such a classic Bond film, it's embarrassingly goofy and holds up poorly.

### Bullet Train

Imagine if Patriot and Survive Style 5+ was a bit more broad but ideal for a few beers and a cartoon antic time.
