Can you believe it's August already? I was just saying how recent March 2020 still feels, helped in no small part by all the Tokyo 2020 signage I've seen while watching bike racing. I can't say that I'm a fan of the weird nationalism that permeates the games, but it was sun to see international teammates congratulating each other. _Spoiler_: Jumbo Visma looked very strong!

August is the beginning of the actual summer here in the bay, so I am gearing-up my use of fans, open windows and light fabrics. We've had nowhere near the heatwave of the rest of the coast, thankfully, but it's still warm enough for me to look forward to another dip in the pool and the eventual breezy fall. The evenings here, when riding up local mountains are pretty chilly, especially on descents, so I've even had to order arm and leg warmers. Over in SF, my regular ride pal Drew reported this as his "coldest summer ever", and as we were screaming down the Twin Peaks descent, shivering the whole way, I saw what he meant.

Seasons are weird.

If you're _a gay_, or just a club kid you may have run into a small yellow bottle of Rush. For me, I first encountered _amyll nitrate_ in the lyrics of this Nigo album:

{{< youtube Q0_-GZPhl3c >}}

The [story of this bottle, and how it keeps being sold](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/amphtml/davidmack/poppers-factory) is much more wild than I expected.

If that story of fast highs wasn't deadly enough for you, I invite you to read (or reread) the [classic Martin Beck series](https://crimereads.com/maj-sjowall-and-per-wahloo-a-crime-readers-guide-to-the-classics/) by Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö. It's a bit grim, and very delightfully procedural. It's also a fantastic intro to the world of Scandinavian noir.

In case you still need some mystery, try [this soda machine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill%27s_mystery_soda_machine) on for size. Personally, I grew up drinking a _lot_ of soda, so I really would've loved this machine, though it might've made my [relationship with hydration](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3depb/why-millennials-have-a-weird-relationship-with-water-and-hydration) even more strained. Do you drink 8 glasses of the clear stuff daily? Maybe in one of these [bonkers vessels](https://www.amazon.com/Reusable-Odorless-Capacity-Climbing-Semitransparent/dp/B07FXQDJT6/ref=sxin_13)?

I can't wait until 3021 when our descendants are still lamenting the [end of Google Reader](https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/21/22586870/google-reader-ode-end-of-the-good-internet) and our nerdiest and most astute great-great-great grand children are saying, "what about [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com), [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com), [Newsblur](https://www.newsblur.com), or [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com)?!?" That's right! You don't have to live in the past, you can live in the present day of the _[delights of RSS](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2020-02-22-a-twitter-experiment-using-rss-to-readonly-twitter/)_. 

Finally, (insert bass line) _what's the deal_ with our need to [pathologize our behavior](https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/pkbywn/tiktok-pathologise-normal-behaviour-mental-health), and what does it have to do with online community? As a woman in therapy in my 30s, I've certainly had my fair share of mental heath challenges, but my therapists have all been pretty insistent that focusing on a diagnosis might not be helpful outside of a billing standpoint. If this is upsetting to read about, you might have anxiety, lol.

## Closing

Well I'm off to do a little hill-climb ride with a few pals, so I'll bid you adieu for now. Wherever you are I hope you can get outside and enjoy a little sun and a cold glass of whatever you fancy. See you next week, space cowgirls~
