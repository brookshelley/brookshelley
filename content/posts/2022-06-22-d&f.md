# D&F 6/26/22

Today was all blue skies and dirt roads as I climbed gravel hills in Oakland. I finished my night over beers with my friend Emily, and counted my blessings that the weather held up so perfectly.

This week was fortunately short, but I am still stoked that next week is also short. Something about the summer and life right now means needing even more time and space to enjoy the outdoors. 

Rights are under attack in a new and insidious way, and people are suffering as the ancient greedy assholes who run the country offer thoughts and prayers. This [Godspeed song narrated by TikTok voice](https://friend.camp/@casey/108528667367079799) captures the insane feeling of 2022 perfectly.

Between an erosion of rights and the horrific climate change we're dealing with, the world feels like it's ending faster than I expected. Tech companies want credit for fixing things, but often their work isn't effective because they're not working on emissions [holistically](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/could-googles-carbon-emissions-have-effectively-doubled-overnight). One small saving grace is the companies who are focused on privacy and finding more humane ways of doing the tasks we rely onâ€”like [Kagi](https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-orion-public-beta) seems to. I'm not sure if these companies will last, but the idea that places might stay focused on security, privacy, and longevity over profit at all cost gives me some hope.

The last decade gave us a lot of short-lived social media that led to tons of [dead websites](https://notebook.wesleyac.com/how-websites-die/). The next ten years would be way better with blogging and emails coming back, and interesting shit landing in my RSS app every week but maybe [all we get is punctuality](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/style/punctuality-is-having-a-moment.html).

Regardless of whether we can make the world a better place, we can at least work on ourselves(?). This article encapsulates something like [a decade of my therapy](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/10/psychotherapy-childhood-mental-health) and you can have it for free. Attachment, it's wild.

## Closing

I'm wiped! Thanks for reading a relatively scattered email today, next week should be a little more connected and consistent. I'm off to watch more Barry and try to relax a bit. Keep fighting, and stay strong, space cowgirls~
