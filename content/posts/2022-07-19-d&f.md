No camping this week so I'm back with my regular linked-packed newsletter. I very nearly went out on another camping trip this weekend, but instead opted to go up a bunch of hills and overheat. 

Summertime, baby!

Just in case you thought the kids were ok, and the next generation was going to save us, good news, TikTok is filthy with [Christo-facist propaganda](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvmxwz/tik-tok-chrsitian-nationalism). At this point talking about being off Twitter and how Twitter is the worst is selling past the close, but Max Read's article on [leaving social media](https://www.bookforum.com/print/2703/a-psychoanalytic-reading-of-social-media-and-the-death-drive-24171) still resonates.

After over two years of pandemic and predominantly remote work for folks in my industry, there's a lot of bustle about "hybrid" work. I love the flexibility of working from my house, but the mix is going to be [weird as hell](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/07/work-from-home-rto-flexibility/661495/). The mix of office and remote makes a strange time for [new grads, and new ideas](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/07/remote-work-wfh-debate-management/670482/). I do worry that the Google guy quoted in this [piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/07/remote-work-wfh-debate-management/670482/) might just be a misanthrope though. Personally, I find being around a bunch of semi-strangers in a large building I have to commute an hour to get to is incredibly stressful and frustrating, but I have teammates who feel the opposite. I don't know what the answer is yet, but I really hope it's not repeatedly getting sick and smelling other people's farts in meeting rooms again.

Regardless of how we work, I refuse to give up [enjoying vacations](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210914-the-way-we-view-free-time-is-making-us-less-happy). Even with a pandemic, it's been invaluable to take a week or two off to play video games, go camping, or just read books. I miss traveling, but I've missed every wave of travel safety since my comfort zone lags like six months behind most people. As soon as I can though, I'm leaving the country for a while.

## Closing

This week I'm rewatching the [classic show Detroiters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroiters_(TV_series)) and the triumphant return of Nathan Fielder to tv with The Rehearsal. The world may be a shithole a lot of the time, but we've got some great comedy.

I hope you're tucking into something fun this weekend and doing some daydreaming. The rest of my month includes a birthday party for the coolest toddler I know, and my first wedding in years (for one of the sweetest, raddest dudes). As always, H A G S, space cowgirls~
