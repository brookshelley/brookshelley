For me this weekend started with very sore legs, and a live show from the folks at [Rude Tales of Magic](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rude-tales-of-magic/id1480593911). The show was a pretty bizarre and hilarious send-up of war, that also included a high-speed drifting casket. RIP Han. I don't listen to a lot of roleplaying podcasts, but out of all the ones I've heard, Rude Tales is the most consistently funny. 

Queue up a nice cover of a Prince song:

February is _over_! We did it. Ten more months to go! I'm hoping 2022 is a year where travel is a thing again, so I'm just thinking about getting through a 2021 of largely not leaving Oakland. Maybe [being ~a 40BMI will finally mean something positive for me](https://www.vogue.com/article/covid-19-vaccine-bmi-qualifier), but much like the linked author, I feel complicated feelings about this. I also feel a lot of frustration at people making jokes about _gaining weight_ to get access to vaccines. Fuck you. BMI is a nightmarish joke though.

Top tip from me: read the item description and don't just look at the photo when you order a cycling shirt, or you might end up with a bright pink one.

Whoops.

All good writing is just [pointing at things](https://austinkleon.com/2021/02/16/pointing-at-things/). No, not that kind of [pointing at things](http://pointingatthings.com), but the good kind. The kind that says, "hey you know what? This is cool!" There's a lot of cool stuff, so writing is pretty easy. Or at least my friend Joe makes it look easy by writing about [broken sex dolls](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-mr-fix-its-who-save-broken-sex-dolls). 

Perhaps you'd like to write, but for some strange reason you've been waiting for a blogging platform that is fed solely by email. Well, you're in luck (soon), because the folks from Basecamp are testing [world.hey.com](https://world.hey.com/jason). You might enjoy [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) if you like something a bit more complicated, or something like [my Micro.blog](https://micro.brookshelley.com), which I don't really use.

You know what's cool? [William Gibson](https://compendiumofcool.com/essays/wg-cool/). I still don't understand how this older southern ex-pat because so dang rad, but there he goes, surfing the edge of cool. Less cool is the latest book by Kim Stanley Robinson, which [this review fully skewers](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/the-ministry-for-the-future-or-do-authors-dream-of-electric-jeeps). And even colder still is [the problematic fave _your fave is problematic_](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/style/your-fave-is-problematic-tumblr.html). It turns out being angry and too immature to understand nuance is a _whole mood_ as the kids say. Sure, some people are awful, awful shits, but a lot of folks are just trying to be alive. I dunno.

All this cold really dried out my skin, so regardless of what I l[earn in this article](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/best-sheet-masks/), I'm reaching for a placenta and charcoal face mask, or maybe just a bunch of mayonnaise and two cold cucumbers to put over my eyes, like a fancy lady.

Maybe we should all just learn [how to love TikTok](https://kylechayka.substack.com/p/essay-how-do-you-describe-tiktok) and stop caring so much about everything else. [Here's one to take away the pain](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMe2nDRQh/).

## Closing

February went by in the blink of an eye. It's nearly spring, and soon I can watch the flowers out of my window bloom while still quarantining. My quarantine mood waxes and wanes, and I'm definitely waning lately. Luckily, there's still plenty of wine to be drunk, and plenty of virtual bike riding to do. Snorri also seems nonplussed at the whole pandemic, which is a pretty solid attitude.I really hope I never have to explain to him that I'm going back to an office. I don't think he'll take it well.

Hopefully you have some nice spring plans that involve going to parks and breathing in some flowery air soon. Let's all have a picnic separately and compare notes, even if our picnic is in our own living room. 

I'll see you in March, space cowgirls~
