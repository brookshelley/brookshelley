## TV

### Scavenger’s Reign

One of the coolest  and best animated sci-fi ever.

### The Bear (Season 2)

Each episode was as tense and true as the last.

### The Curse

Wow, what a fucking trip.

### Jury Duty

Absurd, but the real treat is Ronald.

### Beef

Reminiscent of a lot of my church days.

### Blue Eye Samurai

This is the year for western animation. So cool.

### Adventure Time: Fiona and Cake

A poignant continuation of one of my favorite shows.

## Games

### Baldur’s Gate 3

Look, it’s obvious this is an incredible game with so much detail and weird little pieces that I could probably play different ways for years. So good.

### Zelda ToTK

Ditto. Custom building? Flying around on a little hover bike? The joy of exploration? Yep.

### Thronefall

Scratched my RTS itch with short playthroughs and fun stages.

### Moonring

It’s not technically out yet but it’s awesome. Old-school RPG joy.

### Alan Wake 2

The closest you can get to playing a David Lynch film.

### Chants of Senarr 

I got stuck on a few puzzles for a while, but broadly it was something I couldn’t put down. I beat it at 5am on morning after an 11 hour play through and that was a day well-spent.

### Dredge

Another game I actually beat this year. Charming and weird.
