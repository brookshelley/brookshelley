I'm back from the wilderness! This weekend, I went with some friends to the Sierra mountains, and hiked to a lake. It was gorgeous, and we camped and drank whiskey without mishap. Well, there was one leech, but with the fast fingers of Drew, it was dispatched.

The trails were relatively quiet, and even though a few other groups camped nearby, it felt like we were the only ones out there. Lizards aplenty, and gorgeous trees. I can't wait to go back, even though Snorri may never forgive me for leaving the house.

When I got back to my car, I opened the glovebox to eat some emergency peanut butter, and noticed a "best buy date" a few months in the past, and it got me thinking, "[what even is a best buy date](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/22559293/food-waste-expiration-label-best-before)?!?"

Months ago I decided to stop using Twitter, for a variety of complex reasons. It's great to not open that site and immediately be reminded about the tyranny of minor differences and a completely unhinged attempt by most users to either _get famous_ or attack strangers for various real or perceived injustices.

This week the second season of I Think You Should Leave launched, and [this interview with its creator](https://www.vulture.com/article/tim-robinson-i-think-you-should-leave.html) is worth a read. I've watched the second season twice already, and my camping crew had to hear me endlessly quoting the inanity.

## Closing

This week's edition is a bit short because honestly, I'm wiped-out from the hiking and camping. I hope your weekend was exciting and restful as well. I'm tucking into some sushi and a bit of wine, then off to bed. HAGs, space cowgirls~
