After a day of cycling and axe-throwing yesterday, I fell asleep at 10pm which meant this newsletter's delayed sending. I'm usually not asleep until 2am most nights, but I've considered trying to go to bed by midnight for a while now. It remains to be seen if that ever happens. 

On more important matters, did you vote in the recall election yet? If not, please do (vote to keep Newsom). Next election we can support and vote for a candidate that is more left, but for now, sadly this is a fight against the absolute nightmare, Larry Elder. I don't enjoy voting for center-left politicians at all, but I'm hopeful in my lifetime we can field more anti-capitalist politicians at some point.

Maybe we can even get a [Solarpunk](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx5aym/solarpunk-is-not-about-pretty-aesthetics-its-about-the-end-of-capitalism) candidate someday. I'm skeptical of utopian futures, but Solarpunk is at least more fun than embracing nihilism. It's likely a Solarpunk person would carry something made of jute, but maybe they too would repurpose some farm bags to make a [stylish backpack](https://intocarry.co/). Much more questionably sustainable is [the coffee I'm drinking right now](https://cometeer.com). I bought some on a lark after hearing it mentioned on [All Consuming](https://allconsuming.show) and it's convenient, and pretty tasty. I do miss the ritual of grinding beans and doing a pourover though, so I'm not sure if I'll order again. This is not to mention the definitely less economical and environmentally-friendly manufacturing of single-use coffee pods.

Both this newsletter and my [blog](https://www.brookshelley.com) are written in Markdown, but if you are the kind of person who uses spreadsheets for everything, you might enjoy ["sheet-posting"](https://www.sheet-posting.me). Glitch has a strange and sometimes checkered past with hiring and firing, but at its best it still leads to some cool stuff. There's a world of low-to-no-code internet tools around these days for making sites, newsletters, and even apps and I hope that even if you aren't a "coder" you give writing and blogging a chance. I would always love to have more blogs from friends and interesting people in [my RSS app](https://www.reederapp.com). 

Friendship _over_ [with friendship](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/how-friendships-change-over-time-in-adulthood/411466/)? Nah, friends rule, and for me they are my primary relationship in life. From acquaintances and coworkers, to my ride-or-die chosen family, friends fill my life with joy, and I've fought to keep that the case. In my experience you _always_ choose your friends and family, so make good choices, and don't be afraid to move on from people that make you unhappy.

## Closing

Well, thanks again for reading, despite this arriving a few hours late. I'm watching the Formula 1 Monza GP as I write this closing graph, but my main plan today is a long, chill bike ride. I hope you can enjoy the end of summer in the best way, and that you look forward to sweater weather as much as I do. Until next week, keep cozy, and keep fighting, space cowgirls~
