I'm wiped today, after a six hour bike with with friends of the 'letter June and Rory. We took June's sister up and around Mount Tam, but also rode from my house in the east bay, which meant a total of six hours of riding and trying to down as much sugar and carbohydrate as possible. As I sit here now, I'm cold, but happy that I set personal records on a bunch of sections of the ride. Next month, I'm headed to Belgium to do a little racing and a lot of exploration with the folks from [Escape Collective](https://escapecollective.com). I've loved the articles and podcasts they've posted over the past year or so of subscribing, and I highly recommend you signing-up if you like cycling and independent journalism. 

Since I'm so tired, today will be a little short, but look for a more rested author to get you more links and words in April. Happy spring!

## Links

- As we enter the fourth month of the current administration, I think more people are realizing that [the world can't afford the rich](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00723-3). There are so many resources on this planet, and if we shared it we could all be doing well. In the US, the millions of _temporarily embarrassed billionaires_ vote for folks who do nothing but line their pockets, and the only way that will change is if there are candidates with campaigns that speak about other options and policies that help the lives of the average person. I still don't know how long it will take to reverse the anti-government sentiment so many Americans have, but if we can unite in the idea that the state should support and care for its citizens in return for taxation, we'll get somewhere. Until then, we get [this](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/16/i-knew-one-day-id-have-to-watch-powerful-men-burn-the-world-down-i-just-didnt-expect-them-to-be-such-losers)
- In honor of a trip to Belgium (where some folks speak a language similar to Dutch), here is the wonderful world of [Dutch cursing](https://www.mezzoguild.com/learn/dutch/phrases/cursing/).
- If you've never experienced the wild world of [_cyberpunk_](https://filmmakermagazine.com/127295-joanne-mcneil-cyberpunk/) in film or literature, I highly recommend it. One of the creators of the style, William Gibson, didn't like the term at first, but it's a really neat aesthetic I think, that when wielded by feminist and queer authors especially captures the feeling of a post-industrial, post-capitalist society.
- Finally, what if [cephalopods](https://pacificklaus.com/the-silurian-hypothesis-it-was-the-cephalopods/) were the ancient alien civilization we were looking for all along. I love this kind of fun scientific speculation.

## Closing

I hope a few of those links gave you something to think about or laugh about, as it's a tough time for so many lately. Keep taking care of yourself, asking for support, and caring for your family. Also a special shout out to very good friend of the 'letter Drew for a cool new change in his life. I wish you all the ease and happiness in the world over the next few yearsâ€”you're an awesome guy and I'm so proud to know you. 

Thanks for reading, space cowgirls~
