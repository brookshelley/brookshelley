One down, eleven to go! 2021 is still all _stonks_ and a mad scramble to [unfuck](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/16/how-to-fix-social-media-trump-ban-free-speech) the mess the last White House inhabitants left. I bet the letter in the desk just said, "LOL" in crayon. Sorry if that's too orange Cheeto for you.

Queue up some wild tunes, bc this shit is about to go off the rails:

{{< youtube gpfpYTmohAk >}}

A few people asked me to explain the Gamestop games stock gamestonk situation, and j'refuse. One friend (hi André) even asked me over the phone after waking me from an accidental ten-hour slumber. It felt like a fever dream. It will be darkly funny once Congress gets a bunch of folks in to grill them on why they can't post to Facebook again.

I also described Gab this week as "the worst coders from 4ch tried to make an twitter." I think we might not even need one twitter.

Look, Rusty on Today in Tabs [does this bit better than me](https://www.todayintabs.com).

As I write this, I just snoozed "make a hair appointment" for the 12th time since quarantine started, and boy, I sure do need someone to cut some of my hairs. Helen and I watched Judge John Hodgeman tell a _wildly ripped_ Kumail Nanjani to cut is own hair today.

What tasks have you indefinitely postponed that you don't even really enjoy? Dentist visits? Pet nail trimming?

In a fit of pique this week, I started using [Airtable](https://airtable.com) to track my entire wardrobe, [like this guy](https://www.reaktor.com/blog/why-ive-tracked-every-single-piece-of-clothing-ive-worn-for-three-years/) with a lot more fancy coding. I don't know if I learned much, but I did finally throw away a shirt that was more holes than material.

Are you ready for some _old school Tumblr memories_? No, [these](https://heritageposts.tumblr.com) don't have any [female-presenting nipples](https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/female+presenting+nipples?sort=top). If your internet time machine malfunctions a bit you might meet pre-network TV [Ice Cube on Johnny Mneunomic](https://t.co/WsSwYwDNnr). 

Continuing our trip into the past, this orphan story is the [worst Batman prequel I've ever read](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/01/orphans-smallpox-vaccine-distribution/617646/). Like, yikes! I'm glad this isn't how we're moving vaccines around these days. Sorry, this was dark.

Let's look at some _[tiny lizards](https://gizmodo.com/ridiculously-tiny-chameleons-discovered-in-madagascar-1846151399)_ instead for a minute. A funnier friend said "comma chameleon" and I'm still mad. If you're feeling a bit mad yourself, don't worry, because there's an [app for that](https://thebaffler.com/latest/i-feel-better-now-bittle). Personally, I recommend the thing where you just have an awkward video call with a trained professional once to many times a week. I think it's made me a better person, but your mileage may vary.

You can also pick up a nice book and read it, which I'm pretty sure can provide calm, happiness, and at least a few hours of escape. Might I recommend something by [Jenny Offill](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/09/jenny-offill-weather-climate-crisis-coronavirus-donald-trump)? My other recommended habit/hobby is going outside and cycling. I hope one day Oakland closes even more streets to cars like the [city of Bogota already does](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/03/bogota-colombia-ciclovia-bans-cars-on-roads-each-sunday/). I've ridding a bit more lately, and even got some f[ancy pedals which I wrote about](https://www.brookshelley.com/posts/2021-01-30-going-clipless/) in a way that led me to revisit my entire adult bike history. Good news though—there's photos too.

## Closing

I wrote this later than usual because I spent the day walking around Berkeley with my friend Helen, and then sitting outside and trying to watch SF Sketchfest over the internet with our pal Drew sitting on the iPad screen on a box of cat food nearby. It was mildly successful. The [sushi was great](https://www.mujiri-oakland.com) and so was [the beer](https://www.novelbrewing.com). I think allowing outdoor dining is still a bit premature, but I'm glad I can go on a walk with a pal and drink at a distance one on one. I hope you got to enjoy the sun this weekend too, and maybe even see someone you care about at a safe and comfortable distance. 

I'm going to go watch the new episode of [You Look Nice Today](https://www.youlooknicetoday.com/episodes), and finish preparing my sourdough.

As always, thanks for reading, and keep safe space cowgirls~
