Happy Paris Roubaix weekend, the queen of the north! If you're not familiar, this bike race is one of the most famous, grueling, and brutal on the calendar. Last March promised to be the first women's edition, but due to COVID, that was [postponed until yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9G8ph1VwZY). It was muddy, slick, and looked awful. On the other hand, the top women were crying with happiness, despite bloody hands and mud-spattered jerseys.

Inspired by their efforts, I set out on a 100km ride of my own, but without feed zones, or the rain. I also went a lot slower. I did however have "an off," as I descended a section a little too fast and forgot to scrub speed until just before the turn, when I locked both tires and drifted my way into a one foot down, over the handlebars wipeout. I am fine, but it was a mistake I don't want to repeat anytime soon. Disc brakes are much more effective than rim brakes, and in those few seconds, suddenly remembered just how much.

If you work out, you may have heard about "the fat burning zone." Turns out, [it's a myth](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/the-fat-burning-heart-rate-zone-is-a-myth-how-exercise-and-weight-loss-really-work/2018/12/17/548ea93a-fc8e-11e8-83c0-b06139e540e5_story.html). Instead of trying to moderate your efforts for a long period of time, just enjoy your workout for the time you have.

I love this [opportunistic apple man](https://www.grubstreet.com/2021/09/william-mullan-odd-apples-encounter.html). I've enjoyed far more fruits this year than in many years past, and that's partially because of my coworker's love of fruits. We're even starting a sprint series named after fruits, starting with [aprium](https://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/Aprium_4155.php).

## Closing

I had less to share this week than usual partially because I was quite busy, and also because I'm utterly spent as I write this on Saturday night. I hope you enjoy your sunday, and as always, keep loving and keep fighting, space cowgirl~
