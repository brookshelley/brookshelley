The latest season of Bakeoff was super cute. It's fascinating how the always manage to find these baking characters.

## Books

### Chosen Ones

A fun book about the hero myth.

## Movies

### Monster

Fucked me up real good on the plane. Every layer a new arrow in my heart.

### Please Don’t Destroy

Better than the other recent SNL movie but still very much an SNL movie.

### Foe

Plodding but interesting.

### Out of the Furnace

What if John Wick was a steelworker?

### The Marvels

A fun Marvel movie again!

### The Fablemans

Gonna re-listen to the Blank Check episode on this now. A real hard look at what making art is like, and also what it’s like to have a mom with mental illness. The latter was tough.

### Dark Water

Bill Pullman playing a simple country lawyer was a well-needed counter to the extremely grim subject matter. There’s no punishment strong enough to balance the damage imperial capitalism and greed have caused the world.

### Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant

Solid music and a surprisingly well-told story.
