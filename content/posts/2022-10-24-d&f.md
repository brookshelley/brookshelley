One more week till Halloween! As an adult, a holiday where you can get real _mid_ candy from neighbors for free is less exciting, but skeletons and ghosts are still rad. For the past few years I've celebrated at Haley's where we watch classic spooky movies and give candy to the kids who knock on the door. It's a great way to spend an evening.

This week I read a lot about housing and zoning, which dovetails nicely with the number of friends I have who work in urban development. The [problem is _usually_ housing](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/). This post has a few flaws, with SF being the "most productive" city my pick for goofiest. That said, a dense, human-scale city is the way to go for any place that isn't rural, and I hope we get to this in my lifetime in the US. We should also [get cars off the roads,](https://oaklandside.org/2022/10/20/traffic-violence-rapid-response-team-oakland/) or at least vastly limit where they can drive and how fast.

I also learned about consultants who help plan for the growing number of [weather and climate disasters](ttps://www.theverge.com/c/23309499/fema-disaster-consultants-climate-change-homeland) around the world. Stock up on the dial soap, and emergency rafts, because more is coming.

If these posts were a little depressing, it's ok, because she's a 10, but she's [completely incapable of feeling emotions](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/twitter-gradient-accounts-relatable-tweets/671788/). It's telling that so much of younger people's plan for success is "be popular online," when the real way to win is "be popular at a well-paying job".

Finally, as a manager I am happy to say that [talking about productivity without measuring anything](https://ez.substack.com/p/the-death-of-productivity) is absurd and we need to stop. I've worked in enough offices to see all the meta work and roleplaying of office life and how much it fills the hours without adding anything to the bottom line or anyone's happiness. I think the sooner we get rid of fake work and spend all that time outside doing something enjoyable, or just reading a book, the better.

## Closing

I'm socially hungover today, and a bit regular hungover, so I'll bid you adieu until next week with a few questions:

Are you dressing up? Going to a party? Buying cheap candy in bulk on Nov 1st? However you celebrate, may all your treats be tricky, space cowgirls~
