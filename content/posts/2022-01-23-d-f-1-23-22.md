Happy weekend to all the birds that found themselves traveling extremely fast this weekend in the bay. We had gusts up to 70mph overnight, and on my bike ride today I was constantly dodging branches and other detritus. 

My weekend started with a binge of the show Derry Girls, which is just as delightful as I'd heard. The juxtaposition of the horrors of the war between the Irish and the English with the hilarious teen drama of the titular girls was always presented so well. I'll be honest, I didn't know much about "The Troubles" besides the odd Harrison Ford movie or Spooks show, but it's fascinating to see a society trying to get on with life while machine-gun holding troops wander the streets. An episode with a funeral, and one with a Protestant/Catholic sleepover had me laughing so loud I didn't hear the wind. 

Due to [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com) and the Youtube recommendation algorithm, I recently watched a ton of [James Hoffman](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/dining/james-hoffmann-coffee.html) YouTube videos, like this one where he reviews inexpensive espresso machines:

He's way too fiddly about a lot of things, but I appreciate that he approaches a wide-variety of coffee equipment and information with a wry humor. Even if you don't love coffee, he's fun to watch.

This is the real [king of carrot flowers](http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk). I'm trying to get more into vegetables and learn what my body can and can't digest, and carrots continue to be a favorite, whether they're in split-pea soup or just munched like Bugs Bunny.

Whatever your thoughts on the original Dune movie or the (IMO classic) Mullholland Drive, I think we can all agree Lynch is [a strange man](https://www.vice.com/en/article/akv7e4/why-does-david-lynch-have-this-womans-underwear-in-his-mouth). I grew up watching the first Dune movie regularly, but didn't get into his other films until senior year of high school when a TA gave me a copy of A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again, and I mainlined Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, and the rest of his ouvre. I've still never finished Twin Peaks, but I really wish David Lynch made a Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter movie just so we'd know how he could pervert another world. Dennis Hopper as Ron Weasley when?!

## Closing

The weekend is mostly over, which I'm really feeling after two four day weeks. Working five days a week is utter horseshit, and I really hope we eventually learn as a society to move to a 2-3 day work week. Wouldn't you love more time with your friends, or going camping or exploring whenever you want? Ever since reading [Less is More](https://www.jasonhickel.org/less-is-more), I'm more and more invested in the idea that we're just doing too much. Let's slow this whole thing down. On that note, I hope you can take it easy today, and enjoy a nice drink and a clear blue sky. Have a fun, easy winter, space cowgirls~
