Happy UCI Cyclocross World Champs to all those who celebrate. Cyclocross is so dominated by Belgian and Dutch riders that it's hard to cheer too much for any Americans, but [Maghalie](http://www.maghalierochette.com) is pretty cool and Canadian. 

This weekend is a nice cycling one for me as well, with bikes and beer Friday, then a bike and ferry ride on Saturday, and a big SF -> Fairfax -> Oakland ride with pals as you're reading this. It's real spring weather, so I'm trying to enjoy the hell out of it. Reading Craig Mod's [PaperSky Column](https://papersky.jp/en/electric-ride-vol2-oiso/) really makes me want to do some multi-day rides soon too.

I'm not a big Jeopardy fan, but I love that an [Oakland trans woman](https://www.polygon.com/22900817/jeopardy-amy-schneider-most-games-money-records) made a ton of money on the show. Good job Amy! 

Leaving the states for a bit, I was fascinated with how well South Korea is handing COVID, and how much I wish we could do anything like [this](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/a-welcome-unfreedom-in-south-korea) here. A great number of Americans without passports love to think that the US is the best nation in the world, but that is increasingly untrue. As a few generation Texan, there's not much hope of me emigrating due to family roots, but a girl can dream. Maybe we'll find a way to get the US in better shape someday.

## Closing

I've got to get to bed pretty early tonight so I can roll out and get to my meeting point Sunday for the tour ride. I'm decidedly not a morning person, so anything I need to do before 11am is pretty rough. I figure I'll be mostly awake by the time we get across the Golden Gate Bridge. I hope whatever you do today, it's relaxing and with people you like. Toast the dawn, space cowgirls~
