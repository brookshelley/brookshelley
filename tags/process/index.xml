In July, I began sending weekly link emails, which I managed to keep up through the end of the year. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a fun Sunday activity, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d chat a bit about what the experience of weekly link writing was like.</description></item><item><title>A Weekly Link Newsletter</title><link>https://www.brookshelley.com/brookshelley/posts/2019-07-21-newsletter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.brookshelley.com/brookshelley/posts/2019-07-21-newsletter/</guid><description>It’s official: I’ve joined the newsletter trend in earnest. I’ve had a newsletter for a few months now, but I wasn’t sure what to really do with it. Fortunately, I realized what I love to see the most from some of my favorite newsletters is links to what these authors are reading this week—little jewels from internet wanderings.
My re-launched Dill and Fennel newsletter will have links to some of the more interesting or funny things I’ve seen in the previous week.</description></item></channel></rss>
