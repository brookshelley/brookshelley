A rainy month with the back half consisting of a work trip and a few weeks with COVID meant a lot of watching Lost, The Traitors, and other tv. I also played the entirety of Last of Us Part 1, which was a little too linear for my taste.

Decent progress on my Criterion challenge this month.

## Books

**‌Something New Under the Sun**

A friend asked if this was Solarpunk, and I'm not sure, but I said yes.

**Winter Tide**

A nice take it and turn it of Lovecraft.

**Neuromancer**

Still a classic.

## Movies

**Moloch**

**Underwater**

Rewatching an awesome underwater thriller.

**M3GAN**

Hell yea.

**Magic Mike**

This was my Titanic of the 2000s insofar as everyone talking about how good it was made me never want to see it. I got over myself and it was fun.

**Sully**

Tom Hanks playing a guy who's great at planes, and the guy from GUTs making him climb an agrocrag of red tape.

**Deja Vu**

Denzel laughing at physics.

**Roman J. Israel, Esq.**

Colin Farrell was playing the Penguin in this, right?

**Fallen**

Denzel should’ve played Constantine.

**Moonfall**

Great.

**Penguin Highway**

Cute

**Toy Story 4**

I thought I'd seen this, but couldn't remember who "Forky" was. Repeated jokes on Blank Check made me watch and I'm glad I did—cute AF.

**Duplicity**

_very Giamatti voice_ Show me the cream!

**Slumberparty Massacre**

When I saw “Rita Mae Brown” I yelled.

**I Want You Back**

Love a good classic romcom.

**Big Short**

Still hits. Fuck banks.

**Weekend**

My guy, take a typing class.

**Certain Women**

Certain vibes.

**Aftersun**

Dad movies. Fuck. 

**The Post**

The pre-chum box days when reporters still got paid well.

**Vampyr**

I dug the framing in this—angles for days.

**Pearl**

I liked X better, but this was occasionally fun.

**Four Women**

Shorts on my Criterion list feel like cheating usually but I hate interpretive dance.

**Cold Lasagna I Hate Myself**

Very funny.

**Safe**

Haynes captures another side to the creepiness of suburban life and loneliness of illness like the campy cousin to Lynch.

**From Dusk Til Dawn**

Clooney should always have neck tattoos.

**Bergman Island**

I don't think I've seen a single Bergman film, which means a lot of this was likely lost on me. An interesting story regardless. "In Sweden we are very serious about recycling".

**Spook Sport**

The Rude Tales theme!

**Koyaanisqatsi**

First time I've seen this movie without being high, and it holds up.

**Rogue Agent**

He's never really a spy, ladies. Julian Barrett is aging well

**Wendell & Wild**

Excited to hear the Blank Check on this movie. Stop motion is always so cool.
